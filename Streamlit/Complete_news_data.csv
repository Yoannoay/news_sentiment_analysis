      Sunday 2 April 2023 15:09, UKDairy cows could be fed methane suppressants as part of a plan to cut down on greenhouse gases from farming.The government says it is planning to ""encourage"" the use of the suppressants - which can be made out of chemicals or natural ingredients such as seaweed - when they become available on the UK market.Cows produce methane through digestion and release it mostly through ""silent burping"", as well as farting.Scientists say the world's 1.5 billion cattle, each producing up to 500 litres of methane a day, are significant contributors to .The greenhouse gas has more than 80 times the warming power of carbon dioxide during its first 20 years in the atmosphere.In the UK, methane makes up more than half of all greenhouse gases produced in agriculture, according to a 2019 study.And the government believes methane suppressants - which are expected to enter the UK market in 2025 - could help meet the UK's target to achieve  by 2050.""Well-managed livestock can provide various environmental benefits and we plan to encourage the uptake of high efficacy methane suppressing products once they reach the UK market,"" a government spokesperson said.Tom Bradshaw, deputy president of the National Farmers' Union, told Sky News that the development of methane-suppressing products was ""exciting"" for the industry.He said: ""Everybody recognises the need to reduce climatic impact and this is something we are really interested in.""This could be a really positive step for that.""But Mr Bradshaw added there was some suggestion some suppressants could reduce the effectiveness of feeds and more research was still needed.Farmers also face the additional cost of buying the suppressants - at a time when many are facing higher feed and fertiliser costs.Mr Bradshaw suggested this could be counteracted with rewards and incentives from government for producers who reduce their emissions.Cows and other hooved livestock, such as sheep and goats, produce methane while digesting grass and organic-based feeds.Around 70% of all methane emissions from livestock come from this process, with the remaining 30% arising from the storage and application of manure.But methane-suppressing products can cut back on the amount of methane that is produced from digestion by inhibiting or disrupting the enzymes which produce the gas.The suppressants - which can come from chemicals or natural substances, including potentially seaweed and garlic - can be ground into feed and given to animals.The government's plan, which comes after it launched a call for evidence in August last year, is not the first aiming to reduce methane emissions from livestock.Be the first to get Install the Sky News app for freeNew Zealand's government  in a bid to tackle greenhouse gases.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerAnd last year, a  from the then Prince Charles and designer Sir Jony Ive.

We have to be realistic.""She added the government has introduced legislation to speed the policy up.

We have to take action now,"" she said.""That's why we've introduced a bill with tough measures which are both firm and humanitarian.""Ms Braverman also refused to take responsibility for a spike in asylum seekers being housed in temporary accommodation.She insisted the situation is being sorted by deporting ""about 500"" Albanians and signing a deal with the French to enhance cooperation in the Channel.""And we're now about to procure and roll out bespoke accommodation for asylum seekers so we can start taking people out of hotels and moving them into more affordable and appropriate accommodation,"" she added.

                Mayoral elections will also take place in Bedford, Leicester, Mansfield and Middlesbrough.Local elections in Northern Ireland will take place two weeks later on 18 May.There are no local elections in Scotland and Wales.The law was changed last year so voters in Great Britain now have to show photo ID before being issued a ballot paper in polling stations for general, local and police and crime commissioner elections, and referendums.When a similar system was introduced in Northern Ireland in 2003, there was an almost five-point drop in expected turnout but normal patterns were restored in subsequent elections.Most forms of existing photo ID will be accepted, including:• UK, EEA and Commonwealth passports or driving licences• Most concessionary travel cards• Blue Badge• Proof of Age Standards Scheme (PASS) card.Voters can still use photo ID that it is out of date, as long as it still looks like them and the name is the same one used to register to vote.For those who do not have an accepted form of photo ID, their photo no longer looks like them or they are worried about using an existing form, such as due to a gender marker, voters can apply for a free Voter Authority Certificate.The deadline for applying for a certificate for the English local elections is 5pm on 25 April, but people must have registered to vote before applying.People who wish to vote, and are eligible, must make sure they are registered.For those who have not previously registered to vote or, have moved house, the deadline for the 2023 local elections is 11.59pm on 17 April.People who have changed their name but are already registered can either contact their local council's electoral services team and request a name change, or they can register again.You can register online - it takes fives minutes and you need your National Insurance number.For those who cannot do it online they can download a paper form.Voters who want to vote by post need to apply to do so by 5pm on 18 April, and must also have registered to vote by the end of the day on 17 April.Ballots will be sent out about three weeks before polling day and needs to be with their local council by 10pm on polling day to be counted. If you cannot post it in time, you can take the pack to your local polling station or council on polling day.Voters can also get a trusted person to vote on their behalf - a proxy vote - and must apply for this by 5pm on 25 April, after first registering to vote.The Conservatives hold the highest number of seats and councils in England, with the party holding majority control of 85 councils and defending 3,365 seats - 42% of the total seats.Labour has majority control of 50 councils and 2,131 seats while the Lib Dems have control of 16 authorities and are defending 1,223 seats.A third of English councils - 74 - currently have no overall control.The Greens are defending 239 seats and Independents or local parties have majority control over five councils.A combination of UKIP/Brexit/Reform UK are defending 30 seats, according to Sky News analysis.There will be ward boundary changes in 49 authorities - more than a fifth of all councils - and boundaries are being altered in eight metropolitan boroughs, 14 unitary councils and 27 districts.Boundary changes make it much harder to predict how the vote will go as they can encapsulate a different demographic.There are several different types of local authorities. County councils are responsible for larger services across an entire county such as education, transport, social care and fire and public safety.District, borough and city councils provide a second tier and cover a smaller area than county councils, with responsibility for services like recycling, housing and planning applications.In some parts of the country, there is just one tier of local government providing all local services. There are unitary authorities, and London and metropolitan boroughs.Parish, community and town councils operate at a level below district and borough councils, and in some cases under unitary authorities. They provide help on issues such as allotments, bus shelters, play areas, local grants and have the power to issue fixed penalty fines for litter, graffiti, fly posting and dog offences.Be the first to get Install the Sky News app for freeIn England, councillors are elected on four-year terms to either single or multi-member wards using the first-past-the-post electoral system.In most councils (67%), all their seats - the areas of responsibility within the council - are elected at the same time every four years.Nearly a third of councils (31%) see a third of their council seats elected each year for three years out of every four.A very small number (2%) have half their council seats elected every two years.

But he was never paid, tricked into handing over cash and talked into scamming other people. He's one of a soaring number of people in the UK falling foul of recruitment scams.
          Sky News reporter
              
      Sunday 2 April 2023 06:35, UKThe job offer couldn't have come at a better time for Theo. He had been job hunting for a year, picking up part-time hours in events. He was homeless, crashing on friends' couches.""I took the first opportunity that came to me because I was like, I just need to get out of this situation,"" Theo, whose real name is being withheld, told Sky News.From the employer's perspective, he was the perfect candidate: he was desperate, and he didn't ask too many questions.He knows that's what they looked for because when he started, that's who he was told to hire.The ones who weren't put off by the scant information on the company's website. The ones who really needed the money.Except they would never get paid for their work - and they would get scammed out of hundreds of pounds in the process.The scam that got Theo was a multi-pronged attack.First his new ""employer"" told him he'd need to pay for an HR qualification, with the promise of reimbursement as he completed the modules.""They said, it's only going to cost a few hundred pounds, but you're going to have a job, you're going to get monthly income - and, yeah, so I just took it.""He paid £275 to what looked like an external training provider and logged in for his first day.He was told he would be recruiting people. All he needed to do first was buy a burner phone and shell out £118 for a job board CV subscription.The first person he called was ""just some woman who was trying to find a job as well, just as desperately as I was"".""When the roles were reversed and I read the script, and then I remembered the way I was interviewed I was like, okay, this is exactly the same,"" Theo said.""In my mind, I was like, this is not right. But at the same time, I spent a lot of money that I didn't want to walk away without getting refunded.""1. Be wary of generic-sounding jobs that don’t require experience or qualifications2. Check email addresses - do they look official?3. Notice how emails are written - bad grammar, odd phrasing and Americanised English can be red flags4. Watch out for sudden requests for payment5. Watch out for requests to something to get the job, such as training you have to pay for6. Be wary about pace and pressure, scammers want to act quickly7. Beware of a lack of proper procedure, such as not providing a contract or errors in terminology or currency in the contract8. People disappearing suddenly is another warning sign something is wrongTheo is one of a growing number of people falling foul of recruitment scams.The scams aren't new, but as people lost work during the pandemic and recruitment moved online, the trend picked up - and it has accelerated as the cost of living crisis has deepened.The Cyber Helpline, a charity helping victims of cyber crime, has seen a 286% increase in job scams over the last nine months compared with the whole 12 months before that.New  commissioned by Ofcom revealed 30% of adults in the UK have experienced some kind of employment scam.The scams are varied. Some trick people into paying fees for fake visas, qualifications or security checks, others get people to hand over bank details.Some people find they've unintentionally been involved in money laundering or perpetuating the scam, or get tricked into doing real work they never get paid for.Job scams hand criminals the tools to hurt their victims more than once, The Cyber Helpline CEO Rory Innes explained.""Think about what's valuable to criminals - money and information about individuals.""Job fraud's perfect because you can get someone to send you a CV and their passport details and pretend to do a DBS check or criminal record check [...] and then you scam them out of money, so you've made the money, you've also got all the data which you can then use or sell for other scams.""You might think scammers would run for cover once they’ve been found out - but some take it as an opportunity to exploit people again, Mr Innes said.""They'll phone up, pretend to be the police, and say, 'Look, we know you’ve been scammed by this fake company. If you need to put your money into a safe account or if you give us a deposit, we will go and help and recover your money' - and then they get scammed again.""Often people lose more in these recovery scams than they do in the original scam, Mr Innes said, particularly if they’re tricked into handing over their bank details.How much people lose through job scams varies widely. Some, like Theo, will be scammed out of a few hundred pounds. Others lose thousands, even tens of thousands of pounds.But the impact is more than financial, Mr Innes said.""Think of somebody who's lost maybe £2,000. That might remove their ability to pay the rent or feed their children.""The bigger impact on that individual is mental health, it's their ability to be online and trust, but it's also just their day-to-day lives.""Maya, whose real name is being withheld, quit a job she liked for a role at the same company as Theo. She was ""a mess"" when she realised the job she had signed up for didn't exist.""When it all went down I was crying hysterically, not because I've lost out on the money, they can keep the money. It’s the fact that I don't have a job… You need a job, especially in London.""Maya said she's normally switched on to scams but ""everything was perfect"".She got a contract, she had a Zoom interview, the website seemed legitimate and ""nothing was giving me the gut feeling that this was weird"", even when she was asked to pay the £275 training fee.At first glance the company's website seems appropriately furnished with HR buzzwords and office photos. But look a little closer and the pages are peppered with dummy lorem ipsum text, the pictures are stock images and typos abound.These are classic job scam warning signs, JobsAware CEO Keith Rosser said. His organisation helps job scam victims - and they have received 10 complaints about this company alone.Another red flag is generic sounding jobs with low barriers to entry, because the scammers want as many applicants as possible.""Even if every day they are fooling 10% of those people, it's very lucrative for them,"" he said.Prosecution is rare in job scam cases, despite JobsAware and The Cyber Helpline building evidence for police reports.But with police resources stretched and a lot of scammers based abroad and operating online, tracing individuals is difficult.Be the first to get Install the Sky News app for freePauline Smith, head of Action Fraud, the national reporting centre for fraud and cybercrime, confirmed it had received four complaints about the company Theo and Maya claim they were scammed by.At least one is still being assessed by the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) at the City of London Police.Theo left the job after three days, £400 poorer and without the bar shifts he used to rely on.He's wary of job hunting now, ""demoralised"" and only applying to the bigger - but more competitive - companies.Maya had more luck finding work, but she's still having to ask for help with rent over the next few months.""It's definitely affected my trust,"" she said.""To find a job in this day is hard enough. You actually get a job and you get passed through all the ID checks and everything - for it to just be a scam is a shock to the system.""One week I was celebrating. The next week I was crying.""

      Saturday 1 April 2023 04:38, UKVladimir Putin's decision to forward deploy tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus has made headlines around the world - but forward-basing of nuclear weapons has limited military benefit.Intercontinental ballistic missiles have virtually unlimited range, so forward-deploying nuclear weapons to Belarus territory is not driven by military necessity.Symbolically, it provides a nuclear ""shield"" for Belarus.However, the primary benefit is maintaining the omnipresent threat of nuclear confrontation at the forefront of Western leaders' minds, to deter continued western military support for .Although NATO described this latest threat as ""dangerous  rhetoric"", the US response was more sanguine - they saw no indication that Putin was planning to deploy or employ nuclear weapons.So, this appears to be further sabre-rattling by Putin - but at what cost? In Aesop's Tales, The Boy Who Cried Wolf gave numerous false alarms - such that when he spoke the truth he was not believed.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerBe the first to get Install the Sky News app for freeThe concept of Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) while abhorrent, has deterred war between nuclear states. However, non-proliferation agreements - to avoid such weapons falling into the ""wrong"" hands"" - never envisaged that nuclear states might abuse their status to invade non-nuclear states.If Russia was to prevail with such a strategy, nations such as North Korea, China and others would feel emboldened. Nuclear weapons would be the only guarantee of security, thus creating increased tensions between the ""haves"" and ""have-nots"".Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerPutin's invasion of Ukraine is not going well, and he will do anything to deter the West from providing (potentially decisive) military support.But, if a nuclear-armed bully prevails, global security is threatened.Ukraine's forthcoming spring offensive could threaten Russian-occupied Crimea - which has historical significance for Putin.Having threatened nuclear conflict for the past year, but seen the West continue supporting Ukraine unabated, expect Putin to escalate his nuclear rhetoric and potentially bring his nuclear weapons to readiness, just as happened in the Cuban missile crisis in October 1962.Then, with the US military at DEFCON 2, eventually sense prevailed.To date, nations like China and India have avoided overt criticism of Russia's Ukraine adventures, but all have condemned any threat of nuclear escalation. Putin will know that nuclear escalation risks further international isolation, but the war in Ukraine is personal to him, and he loves brinkmanship.But, to be clear, it remains hard to imagine any circumstances in which Putin will pre-emptively use nuclear weapons - he has too much to lose; however, escalating his alarming rhetoric in the pursuit of battlefield success remains an option. Meanwhile, China, North Korea (and others) will be watching intently to see how the West navigates this new challenge - the legacy of this conflict could be profound.Putin has made clear his intent to keep the threat of nuclear war at the forefront of this conflict - but he may judge that he needs to do more than simply cry ""Wolf"" to achieve his objectives.

      Saturday 1 April 2023 11:11, UKJapan has officially reopened part of a town evacuated 12 years ago in the wake of the Fukushima nuclear disaster.The area of Tomioka, southwest of the wrecked , was evacuated following the disaster in March 2011.Its reopening was celebrated on Saturday, in time for the popular cherry blossom season.Former residents and visitors celebrated as they strolled along a street known as ""the cherry blossoms tunnel"".Prime Minister  also joined a ceremony to mark the reopening.""The lifting of the evacuation is by no means a final goal, but the start of the recovery,"" Mr Kishida said at the ceremony.He also pledged to keep working to lift all remaining no-go zones.More than 160,000 residents in the areas surrounding the nuclear power plant were evacuated after a triple meltdown at the facility in March 2011.The meltdown was triggered when four of the site's reactor buildings were damaged in the wake of a 9.0 magnitude earthquake - the most powerful ever recorded in  history.A subsequent tsunami hit the area, sending huge waves over the facility's sea walls, and damaging the plant's backup generators.Around 18,000 died across Japan as a result of the quake and tsunami, while a 20km (12 mile) exclusion zone was put in place as a result of the nuclear meltdown.Despite a major decontamination operation, around 30,000 people are still unable to return home.Tomioka is one of 12 nearby towns fully or partially designated as no-go zones.Parts of the town have previously been reopened, with around 1,600 people - around 10% of the pre-disaster population - having returned so far.In the newly reopened districts, just over 50 of about 2,500 registered residents have reportedly returned or expressed intention to go back to live.""The living environment and many other things still need to be sorted out,"" Tomioka Mayor Ikuo Yamamoto told reporters on Saturday.An evacuation order was lifted in several sections of another hard-hit town, Namie, northwest of the plant, on Friday.Be the first to get Install the Sky News app for freeThe reopened area accounts for only about 20% of the town.In 2021 - a decade after the disaster - it was reported that the Japanese government had spent about 32.1 trillion yen rebuilding the region.Decommissioning the crippled plant is also expected to take decades.

They're soldiers in the military and part of a special unit, and they're taking us to their headquarters.We had met an hour or so earlier when we pulled up outside another small house they operate from, long since abandoned by its owners after a year of continuous shelling from the Russian forces.It's the same across much of the Donbas - the civilians have moved out and the army has moved in.We can't film outside as their location is secret, but we're led into a gloomy corridor and through a curtain.Inside two boys are working, one with a soldering iron and another tapping furiously on a computer, data and codes scrolling up the screen.Beside them, an AK-47 has been leaned against the wall.In a glass-fronted cabinet are rows of sealed plastic tubes, next to the stacks of batteries and covering an entire shelf, piles of neatly stacked drones - the type you'd buy in a high street shop.This secret base is home to the 93rd brigade's kamikaze drone team, known as the Seneca unit.Their job is quite simple, but the danger is acute.The team stationed here take donated drones, reprogramme them so they can't be detected in flight, attach explosives to them using cable ties, go to within one or two kilometres of the , and using virtual reality goggles, fly the drone into the Russian lines.It's crazy - but it works.Anna is the commander of this group of four.

She is an expert at logistics and has been put in charge of the three boys.I ask her what her family thinks of her being here.""They worry. But they can't say anything because I am an adult, and they may agree or disagree, but they do agree to help us,"" she says.She tells me her mum and dad send them care packages and collect donations for them to buy more equipment.Anna reveals she got married during the war, and so I ask her where her husband is.""He's just outside,"" she says, laughing. He is also serving.""We are fighting for our land, for our history, for our culture. We are fighting for our freedom, serenity and fighting for our people.  has stolen everything that is , is Ukrainian culture and Ukrainian history, unfortunately,"" she says.Anna hopes that when this war ends, it will be the end of conflict with Russia for good.She tells me when it's over, she has plans for a new life.""I'm keen on CrossFit, maybe after this, or maybe something else with sport, or maybe I'll have some children, I don't know...""With the call sign ""Miami"", one of the operators is just 18.

It's not just about Konstantinovka, Chasiv Yar, Novodmytrivka, Bakhmut.

But you know your motivation, you know what's behind you is just like a nightmare.""The dedication, determination and complete absence of fear are all the more disturbing to me because I can't help but think that they're mainly younger than my own children, yet every day they risk their lives to kill Russian soldiers.At their headquarters, a young woman in her early 20s with dyed-blue hair stares intently at her computer.Above her and on three walls are large monitors with a mosaic of screens.They are live drone feeds of the Bakhmut battlefield. They pass real-time information to the soldiers fighting on the ground. They can see the Russian soldiers and they can warn the Ukrainian units of their movements.We can't film the feeds because of operational security, but one of the soldiers, Artem, shows me what is happening - and explains Russia's tactics as we watch.""The main purpose now is to make sure that we can hold the city, and we won't give up our flanks because Russians are trying to come around, you see here?"" he says, pointing at the screen.""They are trying to breach us everywhere, like their tactics right now is to constantly attack from every direction.""When artillery or mortars can't be used because of the danger of friendly fire they call up Anna's team and send them to the front to carry out a focused hit.This is a full-on military unit involved in a deadly war, yet one can't forget their age.While we filmed, I could smell a bag of popcorn heating up in the microwave. Like any youngster anywhere in the world perhaps, they like munching on popcorn while working away.It really is heartbreaking to me.This generation is now at war and shouldn't be, but then again, everyone in Ukraine is now.

27,2023-04-02,Sky News,"Antarctica's fastest-changing region has lost 3,000 billion tonnes of ice - enough to bury the Empire State Building 137 times | Climate News | Sky News","Scientists researching a region in West Antarctica say its glaciers play a key role in the world's rising seas as they hold enough water to increase global levels by more than one metre.By  Charlie Bell, news reporter  Tuesday 21 March 2023 12:25, UKMore than 3,000 billion tonnes of ice has been lost in the Antarctic's fastest-changing region - the Amundsen Sea Embayment - in just 25 years.If this quantity of ice was piled on London, it would be stacked 2km high - over seven times the height of the Shard, research by the University of Leeds suggests.Should it be piled on top of Manhattan, the Empire State Building would be buried 137 times over with the ice and snow standing at 61km tall.Located in West Antarctica, the Amundsen Sea Embayment is comprised of 20 major glaciers and covers more than four times the surface area of the UK.It plays a crucial role in the level of the world's oceans.If its glaciers fully melt, so much water is held in its snow and ice that global sea levels would rise by more than a metre.The research, published in the scientific journal Nature Communications, calculated the ""mass balance"" of the Amundsen Sea Embayment.It describes the balance between mass of snow and ice gain due to snowfall and mass lost through calving, where icebergs form at the end of a glacier and drift out to sea.When calving happens faster than the ice is replaced by snowfall, the Embayment loses mass overall - and this contributes to a global rise in sea levels.The result would be the same if the supply of snowfall were to drop.The study saw a net decline of 3,331 billion tonnes of ice between 1996 and 2021 - contributing more than nine millimetres to global sea levels.Dr Benjamin Davison, who led the research, warned there is ""no sign that the process is going to reverse anytime soon"" - but there were ""periods where the rate of mass loss did ease slightly"".""Scientists are monitoring what is happening in the Amundsen Sea Embayment because of the crucial role it plays in sea-level rise,"" he said.""If ocean levels were to rise significantly in future years, there are communities around the world who would experience extreme flooding.""  Scientists observing how air currents move around the world also identified that the Amundsen Sea Embayment had experienced several extreme snowfall events over the 25-year study period. These would see periods of intense snowfall, or inversely, a snow drought.Between 2009 and 2013, the models revealed a period of persistently low snowfall, or ""snow drought"".This lack of nourishing snowfall starved the ice sheet, causing it to lose ice and contribute around 25% more to sea level rise than years of average snowfall.In contrast, the winters of 2019 and 2020 saw very heavy snowfall. This downpour mitigated the sea level contribution from the Amundsen Sea Embayment, reducing it to about half of what it would have been in an average year, according to the scientists' estimates.Satellites such as the European Space Agency's Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellite, which uses sensors that see through cloud even during the long polar night, have transformed the ability of scientists to monitor remote regions and to monitor the incredibly rapid change taking place in Antarctica.

      Monday 20 March 2023 13:17, UK""Everything, everywhere, all at once.""The United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres used these words as he tried to find a way to convey the new scale and pace of the efforts necessary to tackle .And of course, it was an  in yet another call to urgent action for the world.His message lands as  release a major report summarising their work over the last decade.It is a stark synthesis of what has happened and what is to come; that progress on fighting climate change is insufficient, that the solutions to the problem exist, that the window for keeping 1.5C of warming within reach is closing rapidly, and that nothing less than colossal and immediate cuts to carbon emissions across all economies will keep it open.Only if we act now, the report urges, can we still secure a liveable and sustainable future for all.The sheer size and complexity of the challenge of keeping 1.5C of warming alive has been worrying governments and climate diplomats since nations signed up to it in Paris in 2015.But in recent years there have been growing concerns that the target is already impossible to meet.At the  in Egypt in November last year, dire warnings about growing emissions, rising temperatures, and stubbornly high fossil fuel usage rang out in the plenary halls, and the harried refrain of negotiators shuttling between meetings was that this could not be the COP where 1.5 died.The UN Secretary-General is absolutely determined that the target remains sacred, believing that abandoning it will result, in turn, in people giving up.That is perhaps why he has chosen this moment to alter another target.In his speech today he is calling for developed nations (like the UK and the US) to commit to reaching  carbon emissions as close as possible to 2040, rather than 2050.It is the first time he has done this.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerFor many, it will constitute a significant shifting of the goalposts given how entrenched the 2050 target is - in some cases like the UK, even within the law.For others, it is simply common sense that the richest nations, responsible for the vast majority of carbon emissions and therefore climate change, must now do much, much more given how off-track the world is.It is also perhaps a mark of desperation, a last-ditch attempt to galvanise better efforts, and a clear admission that without an extraordinary, additional reduction in emissions, the 1.5C target is slipping out of reach.

      Monday 20 March 2023 15:27, UKPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerIn a controversial move, the United Nations chief is today calling on polluting developed countries like the UK to ""fast forward"" net zero targets by a decade to 2040, warning the ""climate time bomb is ticking"".It comes as the most comprehensive review yet of the state of climate change delivers a bleak picture of humanity's failure to tackle it, warning the window to secure a ""liveable and sustainable future"" is ""rapidly closing"".But climate scientists have rallied to point out there are still grounds for hope.Today's report from the United Nations' IPCC is the culmination of eight years of work by hundreds of the world's leading climate scientists, summarising six underlying reports.The final sign-off by all governments was repeatedly pushed back amid a battle between rich and developing countries over emissions targets and financial aid to vulnerable nations.The last similar report in 2014 paved the way for the ambitious Paris Agreement the following year.The next of its kind won't arrive until 2030, making this effectively the last collective warning and action plan from scientists while the 1.5°C warming is still in reach - though only just.In the year since the last report in this series, the world has suffered ,  and a  - all of which were made worse by climate change.But amid the bleak warnings of lost jobs, homes, crops and lives, scientists insisted there were still grounds for hope.IPCC chair Professor Hoesung Lee painted a picture of a ""liveable sustainable future for all"" - though only if we ""act now.""""We should feel considerable anxiety,"" said Professor Emily Shuckburgh from Cambridge University, who recently co-authored a book on climate change with King Charles, but was not involved with this report.""But hope, rather than despair,"" she added, highlighting that the IPCC said it's still possible to limit warming to the agreed safer threshold of 1.5°C.The report says changes in how we eat, travel, heat our homes and use the land can all cut climate-heating gases, while reducing air pollution, improving health and boosting jobs.And there is enough global capital to rapidly slash climate-heating pollution.""Not despair, but not just hope, because there is a lot of work to do,"" said Dr Friederike Otto, a member of the core writing team and senior lecturer at Imperial College London.""But we don't need any new magic invention that we have to do research on for the next 30 years or so. We have the knowledge... But we also need to implement this.""But because the window to act is ""rapidly closing,"" the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will today attempt to heap pressure on rich nations to make up for lost time.In 2018 the IPCC loudly warned of the ""unprecedented scale of the challenge required to keep warming to 1.5°C"".Five years later, that challenge is ""even greater"" due to a failure to cut emissions enough, it said.""Leaders of developed countries must commit to reaching net zero as close as possible to 2040,"" Mr Guterres is expected to say shortly.""This can be done,"" he will add in an address to launch the report, which he calls ""a how-to guide to defuse the climate time bomb"".Mohamed Adow, director of thinktank Power Shift Africa, said it was ""only fair that Guterres is setting more ambitious goals for wealthier countries who can make the transition more quickly and who have got rich off the back of burning fossil fuels"".But the proposal may spark some backlash for apparently moving the goalposts. Countries are already struggling to meet the previously agreed target of net zero by 2050.Asked about the proposed date change, a UK government spokesperson said: ""Today's report makes clear that nations around the world must work towards far more ambitious climate commitments.""Britain is currently off track to get its emissions to net zero even by 2050, according to an independent assessment last week, and the recent budget was criticised for falling short on climate policies.Rebecca Newsom, head of politics at Greenpeace UK, said: ""Forget distant tropical islands and future generations - we have already seen what 40°C summers and flash flooding look like here in the UK. The wolf is at the door.""Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerThe COP28 climate summit will take place in the United Arab Emirates in December.The findings of the latest IPCC report are supposed to inform those climate negotiations in Dubai.This year's summit is seen as particularly important, taking a ""global stocktake"" of how countries have progressed since the 2015 Paris Agreement.Observers pointed out that every government had signed off on the scientific conclusions released today, which include the call for a ""substantial reduction in fossil fuel use"".The necessary approval process by all nations is designed to ensure governments act on the contents.Yet some countries resist that language in other forums such as the more political COP climate summits, with oil and gas states last year blocking a pledge to ""phase down all fossil fuels"" from the final agreement at COP27 in Egypt.""By signing off the IPCC reports all governments, even those of high-emitting countries such as Saudi Arabia, Australia, the US and the UAE, acknowledge that climate change is a real and present danger,"" said Richard Black from energy thinktank ECIU.The UN will hope there is similar agreement in December - which needs to result in meaningful action.

                To the delight of its creators, experiments on the ground have been successful in producing multi-coloured shooting stars - but the company said it's not possible to know yet if they can be produced in orbit.The hope is that by studying the light emission and trajectory of each 'star', scientists can gather more information on wind speed and atmosphere composition.Originally scheduled for 2020, the launch was delayed due to a satellite malfunction but is now back on track.Naturally, shooting stars occur when meteoroids (space dust and mini asteroids) enter the Earth's atmosphere and burn up, leaving a bright trail of gas in their wake.To recreate this, tiny metal-based pellets around 1cm in size will be sent up in satellites that will orbit the Earth before releasing them around 249 miles (400km) up.The particles are expected to travel a third of the way around the world - that's over 8,000 miles - before hitting the atmosphere at an altitude of 60-80 km and lighting up the night sky. The spectacle will be seen by thousands across different countries and possibly even in the UK.ALE said it ""hopes to give Brits and others all over the world the opportunity to view the world's first live human-made meteor shower"".The company also assured that it will ""take all possible precautions"" to make sure Sky Canvas doesn't hit other man-made objects and increase space debris.

And so I had six weeks of police surveillance. It was very difficult, but it was worth it,"" he says.In cities across Britain, similar transport plans are on the books, provoking harsh reactions.In Oxford, Bristol, Bath, Cambridge, London, Newcastle, Gateshead and more besides, councillors are wrestling with ways of making their urban areas less polluted and less congested whilst healthier and more climate-friendly.So The Climate Show went to Ghent, a city of approaching half a million people. A city transformed by a travel plan in 2017.Getting off the train, we saw an area the size of a football pitch covered in parked bikes: cycling has doubled in the six years since the transport plan came in. We then took a packed tram into the city centre: public transport use is up 12% too.But the real surprise comes in the placid feel of the place: major junctions thronged by carefree pedestrians and crazy multi-occupancy bikes, the minimal traffic dominated by white vans and taxis, as they are some of the few vehicles allowed in.So how has this been achieved? I caught up with deputy mayor Filip as he cycled around his city.""The plan was to make short journeys less attractive for a car and more attractive for anything else,"" he says.Be the first to get Install the Sky News app for freeThe centre of the city is largely barred to vehicles, but suppliers, some health workers and elderly residents are allowed to drive. Outside of that, it is now impossible to drive directly between six surrounding suburbs: you have to go out to the ring road, round and back in, to your destination.A similar approach is planned for Oxford. Going by car is still possible but much less convenient, making the bus, the bike or walking more attractive by comparison and faster than before.""The most beautiful compliment I ever got was that someone said you are the best city composer because for the first time since living here, I hear the birds in the morning,"" Filip says.But some changes are only apparent with a historical eye.What is now a park with shrubs, sculptures and, somewhat bizarrely, built-in mini trampolines, was a car park. They even freed the Reep river from underground imprisonment under another car park. The nearby houses have become waterfront properties.Not all inhabitants are converts.Walter is delivering fresh drinks and frozen food to the city's many restaurants. As he struggles to pull his pallet trolley across cobbled streets, he complains that politicians don't understand working people, about their newly restricted delivery times and what he sees as a new menace: careless cyclists.""They don't have lights, they ride with no hands, they're on their phones, they drive all over the road,"" he says.But Filip believes the plans are popular.He says: ""The opponents are always very loud. But the people who are in favour of such a plan, they are mostly silent, they support you, but you don't hear them.""And if you are in politics, you should have a policy for your city. It should be a policy for the people of the city. Not for the cars.""

I hope it's not too late.""Dolphins in the zone are already behaving in ways scientifically consistent with a dying population, conservation groups have said.""The dolphins have already changed their reproductive pattern - they are giving birth faster. This is a sign just before extinction,"" Ms Essemlali added.The French authorities have been to do more to prevent the high death rate of sea creatures - and have been criticised for not introducing stronger measures.

So that fact that others were sort of scrutinising and saying, 'maybe you should make a change'.""Often we say, 'oh, you can't shame someone into changing', but I was kind of publicly shamed.""Although reports like the IPCC's are often reported as all doom and gloom, that is not entirely fair. They do stress that, despite being on 'thin ice', we do have a chance.The document itself includes a graph called 'multiple opportunities for scaling up climate action' showing massive carbon-cutting solutions.

          News reporter
              
      Tuesday 28 March 2023 12:48, UKA meatball has been made from the recreated flesh of the long-extinct woolly mammoth as part of a project to demonstrate the potential of growing flesh 
 from cells.The mammoth snack was produced by an Australian company called Vow which is aiming to uses cells from unconventional species to create new kinds of meat.Vow's project doesn't involve the slaughter of animals and highlights the link between large-scale livestock production and the destruction of wildlife and the climate crisis.The company has already explored the potential of more than 50 species, including alpaca, buffalo, crocodile, kangaroo, peacocks and different types of fish.The initial idea for the mammoth meatball was from Bas Korsten at the creative agency Wunderman Thompson.Tim Noakesmith, who cofounded Vow, told The Guardian: ""We chose the woolly mammoth because it's a symbol of diversity loss and a symbol of climate change.""Woolly mammoths are thought to have become extinction due to hunting by humans and the warming of the world after the last ice age.

                Vow worked with Professor Ernst Wolvetang, at the Australian Institute for Bioengineering at the University of Queensland, to recreate the mammoth muscle protein.Professor Wolvetang's team took the DNA sequence for mammoth myoglobin, a key muscle protein which gives meat its flavour, and filled in the gaps using DNA from an elephant.This sequence was placed in myoblast stem cells from a sheep, which replicated to grow to the 20 billion cells which were used by the company to grow the mammoth meat.""It was ridiculously easy and fast,"" said Professor Wolvetang. ""We did this in a couple of weeks.""The professor said the initial idea was to produce dodo meat but the required DNA sequences didn't exist.Despite the work which has gone into it, nobody has yet had the honour of being the first person to eat a mammoth meatball.""We haven't seen this protein for thousands of years,"" said Professor Wolvetang.""So we have no idea how our immune system would react when we eat it. But if we did it again, we could certainly do it in a way that would make it more palatable to regulatory bodies.""The large-scale production of meat causes environmental damage, with many studies the climate crisis will only end if there is a huge reduction in meat-eating in wealthy nations.George Peppou, the chief executive of Vow, said his company's plan is to ""transition a few billion meat eaters away from eating (conventional) animal protein to eating things that can be produced in electrified systems"".He added: ""And we believe the best way to do that is to invent meat. We look for cells that are easy to grow, really tasty and nutritious, and then mix and match those cells to create really tasty meat.""Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerVow's first cultivated meat product to be sold to diners will be Japanese quail, which is expected to be in restaurants in Singapore this year.Plant-based alternatives to meat are common but cultured meat like that produced by Vow replicates the taste of conventional meat.A chicken product made by Good Meat is currently the only cultivated meat available to diners and can only be bought in Singapore.However, two companies have now passed an approval process in the US.In 2018, a company used DNA from an extinct animal to create gummy bears made from gelatine from an extinct elephant-like animal called a mastodon.

Many of these journeys can be covered almost as quickly by train, and some of them by bicycle.""Millions of people around the world are facing climate chaos, losing livelihoods or worse, while a tiny minority are burning jet fuel like there's no tomorrow.""Max Thrower, of the Aviation Environment Federation, a group that campaigns on aviation's environmental impacts, said: ""Flying by private jet is the most carbon-intensive way to travel and it's unacceptable that people continue to do it unnecessarily in the midst of a climate emergency.""The fact it continues suggests that the super-rich are laughing in the faces of normal people, who are becoming increasingly concerned about their carbon footprint from flying.""He called for a government crackdown through measures such as an increased tax on private jets, which has been considered recently in France, or by setting a deadline for private planes to be zero emission or face a ban.A spokesperson from the Department for Transport said: ""We are committed to decarbonising aviation, and our jet zero strategy sets out how we can achieve net zero emissions from UK aviation by 2050, without directly limiting demand.""The UK's sustainable aviation fuels programme is one of the most comprehensive in the world, and our £165m advanced fuel fund is kickstarting production. Meanwhile, our recent reforms to the tax on air passengers will ensure those who fly private jets or fly the furthest contribute the most to the public purse.""The UK is decarbonising faster than any other G7 country, and we remain committed to reaching net zero by 2050 while growing the economy and supporting hundreds of thousands of well-paid green jobs.""

These impacts will only intensify in the coming decades.""Even if the global goal of reaching net zero is achieved, the climate will continue to warm for another 30 years, said Chris Stark, the CCC's chief executive, so the UK must prepare for hotter and more unstable conditions.The government's National Adaptation Programme (NAP), however, which sets out its plan to prepare for climate change, ""fails to match the challenge facing the country"", the CCC said.It lacks vision, is not underpinned by tangible outcomes or targets and has not driven policy or implementation across government, they added.The third NAP, due for publication this summer, is a ""make-or-break moment to avoid a further five years of lacklustre planning and preparation"".Gareth Redmond-King, international lead at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said: ""Food supply is just one of the ways our national security is imperilled by an increasingly unstable world.""Last year, gas prices and climate impacts added hundreds of pounds to .""This year, yields of some vegetable crops have fallen off the back of extreme heat and subsequent drought.""Professor Chris Hilson, director of the Centre for Climate and Justice at the University of Reading, said: ""Climate adaptation policy must be joined up with policy on mitigation.""With homes overheating in summer heatwaves, for example, there is little point spending money on this without at the same time tackling poor insulation and energy efficiency to cope with cold winter temperatures.""Green Party MP Caroline Lucas added: ""In the past year we've seen flooding, drought, chronic food shortages and the hottest temperatures on record - the climate emergency has well and truly arrived.""Not only are we ill-equipped for what's happening now, but we're also nowhere near ready for what could happen in the future.

Instead, it has been accused of simply rehashing existing ideas.The government has  as a way to boost energy security and the economy, lower bills and cut carbon.The policy, called Powering Up Britain, contains a raft of measures covering offshore wind, nuclear and green hydrogen, though many had already been announced.But campaigners have criticised it for ""lacking ambition and concrete action.""Kate Norgrove, from the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), described it as a ""half-baked rehash"".""From energy bills to food prices, the current cost of living crisis is driven by our overreliance on fossil fuels,"" she said.""We urgently need to reduce this reliance and see strong action to decarbonise sectors such as agriculture whilst protecting farmers.""So what does today's announcement mean for the average consumer?The government is promising more than £380 million to improve the number of electric vehicle (EV) charging points, seen as essential for persuading people to make the switch from a petrol or diesel car.But there is criticism the new Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate falls short of what is actually needed to shift the car industry to electric power.Currently, he proposed minimum ZEV target trajectory for new cars sold begins at 22% in 2024, increasing to 80% in 2030 before reaching 100% in 2035. ZEV sales were already at at 15% in the year to June 2022.Colin Walker, a transport analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), said the government will need to have ""something up its sleeve"" to build battery factories and ensure the UK's car industry doesn't fall behind the rest of the world.He said: ""The targets broadly track what EV sales are expected to do anyway. If the government were to increase those targets that would further speed the growth of the second-hand EV market enabling more drivers to access the cheaper running costs which can be hundreds of pounds a year.""Officials say the pumps are a ""proven technology"", are much more efficient than traditional boilers and provide a reliable, low-carbon heating solution for homes.""We want to make it as cheap to buy and run a heat pump as a Powering Up Britain 8 gas boiler,"" the government said in today's plans.But the plans around this aren't new, but , taking it through to 2028.While a replacement gas boiler can cost around £1,000 to £3,000, an air source heat pump can cost between £7,000 and £14,000.So the government is offering people £5,000 towards the cost of a new one, in an attempt to convince people to make the switch.Take-up so far has been low, and today's plans remind consumers of what's on the table.The plans promise a commitment to insulate 300,000 of the poorest-performing homes. These households could save £300-400 each year as part of a £1 billion energy efficiency programme.But, it is worth noting this is actually a relatively small number in the grand scheme of the millions of homes that would benefit from better insulation.Glynn Williams, from Grundfos - one of the largest pump manufacturers in the world, said: ""How disappointing to see a supposedly revamped net zero strategy that repeats previous iterations' focus on insulation. We need to address energy inefficiency at source.""""Hydraulic balancing"" -a method of fine-tuning the water that flows through heating systems - could save households up to 20% annually on their bills, with an initial outlay of £120, he said.Onshore wind is quick to build and can provide cheap domestic energy. But new projects are currently effectively banned due to strict planning conditions, and to lift this would be politically contentious. The government swerved a decision on onshore wind, but said it will respond to a consultation on changing planning rules ""in due course"".A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: ""We have always been clear that we support the development of onshore wind where local support exists.""Offshore wind is politically easier to build but practically more difficult. The strategy reiterates a promise of £160m for port infrastructure to help expand offshore wind - a pledge first announced in 2021.A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: ""We have always been clear that we support the development of onshore wind where local support exists.""

However, environmental groups say the incident could have serious consequences for the local area.Monday 27 March 2023 16:53, UKPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerThe RSPB has said it has received reports of ""oiled birds"" around Poole Harbour after a ""potentially catastrophic"" leak from an oil field pipeline.A major incident was  after 200 barrels of reservoir fluid spilt from Wytch Farm oil field, operated by oil and gas firm Perenco, into the water.People have been warned to avoid the water and beaches in the area - while South Dorset MP, Richard Drax, told the Commons on Monday he was ""very concerned at this spill, which is potentially catastrophic"" with the impact on the marine environment ""unknown"".Poole is Europe's largest natural harbour and is recognised as an internationally important wetland. It is a protected area as well as a site of special scientific interest.The RSPB said it is too early to fully assess the damage to wildlife.Peter Robertson, senior site manager at RSPB Arne, which borders the harbour, said: ""We have received reports of oiled birds in the area and we are monitoring the situation closely.""The area is home to numerous bird species such as black-headed gull, Mediterranean gull, redshank and oystercatcher which breed on the coastline, and many other waterbirds which rely on the harbour mudflats for food.""Paul Morton, of the charity Birds of Poole Harbour, said: ""Right now we're in that important transition period where our winter birds are leaving and our summer birds are arriving, many of which use the southern shore of the harbour for feeding, nesting and hunting.""Each month we conduct wetland bird surveys across the harbour to monitor populations of over-wintering birds.""The last survey which was conducted on 5 March logged 5,450 birds along the southern shore in the spill area.""Poole Harbour is home to the only pair of ospreys in southern Britain, having bred for the first time there after an absence of 200 years, Mr Morton said.The male returned from West Africa on the same day as the slick, while the female is expected in early April.Poole Harbour Commissioners, who regulate the harbour, believe the ""surface slick"" is already dispersing.The UK Health Security Agency urged the public not to swim in the harbour or surrounding area, while PHC said the beaches within the harbour should also be avoided for now.Anyone who comes into contact with the fluid - made up of 85% water and 15% oil - is being advised to wash immediately with soap and water.Some environmental groups have claimed the incident will have a ""devastating impact"".Following the leak, the pipeline affected was shut down and booms put on either side to try to contain it.Perenco said it had recovered some of the ""small"" leak by Sunday night.Franck Dy, Perenco's site manager, said: ""Any spill is an extremely serious matter and a full investigation will be launched to ascertain what happened in Poole Harbour.""It is important to stress that the situation is under control, with the discharge of fluids having been stopped and the spill is being contained.""Dorset Police said the incident was being ""overseen by a number of local agencies"" and reiterated the warning not to swim ""until further notice"".Council leader Philip Broadhead said officials were liaising ""with a variety of parties"" but stressed the leak had been contained.Alice Harrison, fossil fuels leader at the Global Witness campaign group, said: ""Whilst the extent of the damage is still unknown, there is no doubt that a huge spill like this will have a devastating impact on the local population and environment in Dorset.""

61,2023-04-02,Sky News,UK government need more than just patriotism to keep up with US and EU in global net-zero race | Business News | Sky News,"As two industrial giants - the US and the EU - are engaged in a transatlantic arm-wrestle over the technology, investment and skills needed for net zero, the UK has effectively said it cannot compete.
          Business correspondent
              
      Thursday 30 March 2023 14:40, UKFaced with a generational triple challenge of delivering a carbon-neutral economy, energy security, and the multi-trillion-pound investments required to make it happen, the government has draped its green ambitions in red, white and blue.The energy security plan (official title ""Powering Up Britain') is awash with Union flags. From the agency that will develop atomic energy, Great British Nuclear, to the programme to improve domestic energy efficiency, Great British Insulation, it feels like a patriotic rebranding of existing plans and consultations, with very little new money.It may be a matter of presentation, but it's a mistake to view the race to net zero as a parochial issue. This is a global competition for technology, innovation, skills and investment. When it comes to money, Britain already finds itself outmuscled by global competitors.Last August, US President Joe Biden announced the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) - a $369bn subsidy plan to secure green industrial investment.The financial incentives to move factories and development to the US are already turning heads in Britain, with the domestic car industry particularly vulnerable as it transitions to an all-electric future.The European Union has responded to this huge protectionist move with one of its own. A response that could be worth €250bn in subsidies is being finalised in Brussels.The UK of course would once have benefitted from collective European muscle flexing, but now it poses yet more competition, and much closer to home.Faced with two industrial giants engaged in a transatlantic arm-wrestle, the UK has effectively said it cannot compete.Instead of trying to keep up in a subsidy race, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is hoping being smarter will make up for being smaller, helped by the financial clout of the City of London.Writing for The Times today, he is explicit: ""Our approach will be different - and better. We are not going toe-to-toe with our friends and allies in some distortive global subsidy race.""Rather than fight a subsidy battle he thinks he is destined to lose, the chancellor hopes the City, and UK innovation, can deliver the investment, skills and jobs required to transform energy supply and the economy.He cites planned reforms of insurance regulation as allowing investors to free up some of an estimated £100bn in capital for green industries.To put that in perspective, the Treasury's own estimate is that the UK requires £60bn a year to hit domestic net-zero targets, and the chancellor has already cited the same reforms as the resource for science and tech investment.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerThere is some state funding for green technologies in this announcement, though very little we did not already know about. Some £20bn will go towards Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) projects, a nascent technology still unproven at scale.Much smaller pots will be aimed at green hydrogen, which has industrial applications that might in time help decarbonise the energy transition's huge demand for steel, as well as for insulation and setting up Great British Nuclear.Yet even with a little state help and a favourable private sector investment environment, a generous direct subsidy is hard to beat. Volkswagen, for example, has already paused its European battery plant plans until it hears whether the EU can match a $10bn subsidy from the US.The green transition is an opportunity for growth as well as a challenge. As every developed economy turns its attention to the energy transition the Treasury estimates it could be worth £1trn to UK business by 2030.And there are huge investments required at home, starting with the expansion of the electricity grid to distribute huge volumes of new renewable energy, all of which will require cables to go under or over communities, and through the labyrinthine planning system.The UK does have advantages in fundamental green industries. Geography has bestowed extensive coastal waters where wind power and expertise flourishes, with floating wind farms the next frontier. Yet the Crown Estate benefits from the licences (through ownership of the seabed) and many of the companies delivering the infrastructure are Scandinavian, demonstrating that the UK is already importing the green transition.Unless flag-waving becomes a renewable energy source it will take more than patriotism to keep up in this global race.

62,2023-04-02,Sky News,Plans to accelerate rise in state pension age frozen | Politics News | Sky News,"Work and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride said uncertainty around life expectancy and the public finances had driven the decision - which Labour branded 'a damning indictment of 13 years of failure'.
          Political reporter
              
      Thursday 30 March 2023 15:19, UKThe government has frozen plans to accelerate the rise in the state pension age.Work and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride confirmed the move following newspaper reports that suggested the government was erring over the plans.The age at which the state pension is payable currently stands at 66, and by the end of 2028, it will have risen to 67.Increasing the state pension age to 68 was scheduled to happen between 2044 and 2046 - but ministers had been contemplating bringing that forward to between 2037 to 2039.Mr Stride said he agreed the rise in the state pension age from 66 to 67 should occur between 2026 and 2028 as planned, but that parliament should ""consider the rise to age 68 again"".He said that decision will be delayed until after the next election, with another review taking place ""within two years of the next parliament"".

                Increasing the state pension age had been on the cards because of the trend of people living longer. However, the coronavirus pandemic changed that, reducing the life expectancy for women by one year and 1.3 years for men - removing a key justification for changing the rules.The decision to delay the changes could also have been influenced by France - at President Emmanuel Macron's proposals to raise the state pension age to 64 - and the Tories' own electoral prospects.Mr Stride told MPs: ""Given the level of uncertainty about the data on life expectancy, labour markets and the public finances, and the significance of these decisions on the lives of millions of people, I am mindful a different decision might be appropriate once these factors are clearer.""I therefore plan for a further review to be undertaken within two years of the next parliament to consider the rise to age 68 again.""The cabinet minister defended his approach, saying it ""continues to provide certainty for those planning for retirement"" while ensuring in the longer term, it is ""sustainable and fair across the generations"".He said the government ""remains committed"" to the principle of the 10-year notice of changes to the state pension age.""The approach I'm setting out today is a responsible and reasonable one,"" he said.""One that continues to provide certainty for those planning for retirement, while ensuring that we take the time to get this right for the longer term, so that the state pension can continue to provide security in retirement and is sustainable and fair across the generations.""Mr Stride confirmed that the increase in life expectancy has ""slowed"" since the first state pension age review was carried out in 2017 - a trend he said was being seen ""to a varying degree across much of the developed world"".He cited an independent report by Baroness Neville-Rolfe carried out in 2022, which he said ""highlights an important challenge: a growing pensioner age population and the affordability and fiscal sustainability of the state pension"".""As a society we should celebrate improvements in life expectancy, which has driven rapidly over the past century and is projected to continue to increase,"" he said.The announcement swiftly received a hostile reception from former cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg, who said: ""Unlike the Labour Party I don't welcome this decision.""That life expectancy from retirement from the 1940s to today has increased by seven years, which would indicate a retirement age of 72 rather than of 67 or 68.""The benefit of long-term decision-making is that it gives everybody the chance to plan well in advance. And the delaying the decision is a decision in itself, and is not exactly a sign of strength.""Labour's shadow work and pension secretary Jon Ashworth welcomed the delay but said the stalling life expectancy rates that drove it were a ""damning indictment"".""Today's announcement that they are not going ahead with accelerating the state pension age is welcome, and it is the right one,"" he said.""But it is the clearest admission yet that a rising tide of poverty is dragging life expectancy down for so many, and stalling life expectancy, going backwards in some of the poorest communities, is a damning indictment of 13 years of failure which the minister should have acknowledged and apologised for today.""

63,2023-04-02,Sky News,Campaigners issue warning over revised net-zero strategy - 'this isn't just some sort of wishy-washy requirement' | Climate News | Sky News,"The government is publishing an updated climate change strategy, pitched as a plan to guarantee UK energy security, but it has hardly any new cash and bets big on carbon capture technology, which some say is a waste of money. 
          Science correspondent
              
      Thursday 30 March 2023 13:27, UKEnvironmental campaigners are considering taking the government back to court over its ""lacklustre"" energy and climate policy.Friends of the Earth is poring over the new revised net-zero strategy, published on Thursday morning, to see if it still fails to meet legal obligations to cut carbon emissions.The campaign group - along with ClientEarth and the Good Law Project - took the government to the High Court last year over its original flagship climate plan, and won.The government has billed its new strategy, published in response to the court case, as a plan to boost energy security and the economy, lower bills and cut carbon.The 30-page Powering Up Britain document contains a raft of measures covering offshore wind, nuclear and green hydrogen, though many had already been announced previously.The commitments include:• A £20bn commitment to invest in controversial technology to capture climate-heating carbon dioxide from the air and store or use it elsewhere - already announced in this year's spring budget• A pledge of £160m for port infrastructure to help expand offshore wind - announced in 2021• A reminder of existing £5,000 grants towards heat pump insulation - and an extension of the scheme to 2028• A new £30m pledge to help boost manufacturing and supply of heat pumps in the UK• More details on existing plans to establish Great British Nuclear, an agency designed to revive the nuclear industry• More than £380m to improve the number of electric vehicle charge points• Confirmation of £240m funding for green hydrogen projects, announced last year• A commitment to insulate 300,000 of the poorest performing homes• An extra £10bn capacity for UK Export Finance, to increase exports from green industriesThe government hopes the policies will leverage significant private investment, to the tune of £100 billion by 2030.Katie de Kauwe, a lawyer with Friends of the Earth, told Sky News they are ""looking very carefully at this revised strategy and seeing whether it does stack up or whether it is indeed just kicking the can down the road.""But under the Climate Change Act, sections 13 and 14 do require plans and policies to enable upcoming carbon budgets to be met.""So this isn't just some sort of wishy-washy requirement. This is something that is hard-edged.""Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerThe strategy largely glosses over recent calls to lift a de facto ban on onshore wind, which is politically contentious but can provide cheap energy and is quick to build. It also keeps quiet on ongoing oil and gas licensing in the North Sea.Although the government was legally obliged by the High Court to publish a revised net zero strategy by the end of March, multi-billion dollar investments in green technology in the US and the EU have also underlined the need for a bold rethink of UK policy.The chancellor Jeremy Hunt played down suggestions that the UK was trying to compete with Washington or even follow its lead.Writing in The Times, he hit out at ""massively distortive subsidies"" in the US and said that instead the UK would do things ""the British way"".""We are not going toe-to-toe with our friends and allies in some distortive global subsidy race.""With the threat of protectionism creeping its way back into the world economy, the long-term solution is not subsidy but security,"" he said.But according to Josh Burke, senior policy fellow on climate change and the environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science, the lack of a ""long-term, economy-wide investment plan"" in the announcement ""undermines investor confidence and prevents the UK from leading the green race"".""Instead of grasping this historic moment the government has been left trailing behind the [US's] Inflation Reduction Act and is currently failing to capitalise on the opportunities a green transition will provide,"" he said.Some companies have already said they are considering withdrawing from the UK to focus on projects in the US because of multi-billion dollar tax incentives unveiled by President Joe Biden.Others have warned they need a level playing field to compete on the world stage.The UK start-up, Naked Energy, has invented an innovative device for collecting warmth from the sun and turning that into heat and hot water for large buildings such as hotels and hospitals.Christophe Williams, the company's chief executive, said the government must support homegrown manufacturing.""The technologies to help with the energy transition are out there,"" Mr Williams told Sky News.""But they need more raising of awareness, policy support and financial support to get them on buildings, to get businesses and communities saving money and doing it in a cleaner way.""Be the first to get Install the Sky News app for freeProponents argue that Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is important in the transition to cleaner energy.But others warn it will allow continued use of fossil fuels, undermining efforts to leave oil and gas in the ground.Dr Peter Connor, associate professor of sustainable energy policy at the University of Exeter, said: ""Easily the best funded plank of this policy initiative is Carbon Capture and Storage, £20bn for a technology which has previously proved to be great at sucking in money with little to show in terms of large-scale reduction of carbon entering the atmosphere. This is a commitment to maintaining the status quo of burning fossil fuels.""Other scientists said plans to insulate houses to make them more energy efficient were inadequate.Professor of international and climate change politics at The University of Manchester, Matthew Paterson, called the retrofit scheme the ""Cinderella part of the package"".""300,000 homes to retrofit is laughably limited given how big the challenge is of the UK's leaky homes,"" Mr Paterson said.

      Wednesday 8 March 2023 14:49, UKPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerThe emotion as chairwoman Rena Lee announced that a UN high seas treaty had finally been agreed reflected her exhaustion, relief and the sheer human endeavour that multilateralism entails.In a divided world, getting 193 nations to consensuson anything is hard.But reaching a brand new politically-sensitive pact covering nearly two thirds of the planet's oceans that don't actually belong to anyone is another thing entirely.That's why UN member states have been struggling for the best part of two decades to find a way of protecting the high seas.On paper, they have done just that, and not a moment too soon.Our oceans and the biodiversity within them sustain life on Earth.They produce nearly half of the planet's oxygen and absorb a quarter of its carbon dioxide and the excess heat that it generates.But they are under severe threat from pollution, overfishing and global warming.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerAs US climate envoy John Kerry put it recently: ""The ocean is life itself.""That life is being threatened because of the very reckless and careless activities of human beings without thinking about the impact and without taking into account that it is a living organism, a living system. And given the wrong inputs that system can be killed.""Actor and activist Jane Fonda put it rather less delicately: ""We're pooping in our kennel. We are supposed to be so smart. We are destroying things we don't even understand.""The treaty, in a nutshell, will provide a legal framework for establishing vast marine protected areas (MPAs).
This means that all activities that go on in the high seas will be subject to environmental impact assessments, with member states held accountable for their actions.The treaty itself focuses on four main areas, according to charity WWF: marine genetic resources, area-based management tools, environmental impact assessments, and the transfer of marine technology and building of capacity.
This could mean restrictions on how much fishing can take place and on activities such as deep-seabed mining and deep-sea carbon capture and storage.Before now, efforts to protect marine species including dolphins and whales — and human communities that rely on fishing or tourism related to marine life — have been hampered by a confusing patchwork of laws.It is hoped that the obligation on developed states to share knowledge and technologies, and to build capacity, will result in, particularly developing nations, participating more in the conservation of the high seas.Jessica Battle, oceans governance expert at the Worldwide Fund for Nature, said: ""This treaty will help to knit together the different regional treaties to be able to address threats and concerns.""So the UN high seas treaty really is a milestone in a journey littered with failures and false starts.But there is still a long way to go.The deal establishes the legal framework for the creation of vast marine protected areas which will help to control fishing, deep-sea mining and shipping, as well as agreeing on the equitable distribution of newly discovered resources.This will be tremendously complicated in practice, involving overlapping and competing industries and organisations finding a way to work in harmony in what has essentially been a lawless place.Experts have already warned that the treaty must be rapidly adopted, ratified and implemented in order to make a genuine impact.And, they warn, it is not yet clear how any of this will be enforced.As delegates travel home from New York, they will be aware of all of this, and that the hard work has really only just begun.But on this occasion, they will also know that they have been a part of shaping an historic agreement, one that shows the power of multilateralism and how it can help us fight the climate crisis.

The environment secretary has let water companies get away with these environmental crimes for far too long.""It is clear she simply doesn't care enough to get tough on these polluting firms. Therese Coffey must now resign or be sacked so we can have an environment secretary who actually cares about saving our rivers from destruction.""There were 301,091 sewage spills in 2022 according to the latest Environment Agency figures - an average of 824 a day.This was a decrease of almost a fifth but the falling number of discharges was due to dry weather rather than measures taken by water companies.Ms Coffey's plans also include a six-week consultation examining the possibility of strengthening the Environment Agency's ability to impose sanctions without going through the courts.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the most serious cases will still be taken through criminal proceedings but that all other penalties would be quicker and easier to enforce.Currently penalties and fines imposed by water regulator Ofwat are returned to the Treasury but under the new plans, money will instead be returned to Defra.Speaking about her plans, Ms Coffey said: ""I know how important our beautiful rivers, lakes, streams and coastlines are for people and nature - and I couldn't agree more that more needs to be done to protect them.""I want to make sure that regulators have the powers and tools to take tough action against companies that are breaking the rules, and to do so more quickly.""Through the Water Restoration Fund, I will be making sure that money from higher fines and penalties - taken from water company profits, not customers - is channelled directly back into the rivers, lakes and streams where it is needed.""Campaigners have accused water companies of discharging sewage far more often than they should, including when there has been no rain, and have repeatedly called on water companies to use their profits to invest in more infrastructure.

As have plans to accelerate technology for small modular reactors - as far back as 2015.A pledge of £160m for port infrastructure to help expand offshore wind was announced in 2021, and £240m of funding for green hydrogen projects was announced last year.The government confirmed it would insulate 300,000 of the worst homes for leaking heat, which amounted to greater detail on a pledge from last year, which will come out of an existing £1bn pot of money.Kate Norgrove, WWF's executive director of advocacy & campaigns, said: ""While there is some wheat among the chaff, today's announcements are a half-baked rehash of existing commitments that fail to meet the strong public call for environmental action.""Today the government confirmed over £350m of investment for electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure - with charging accessibility being a complaint of many electric vehicle owners. Sky News has asked the government whether this is new money but has not yet received a response.But what is expected to really drive the switch from petrol and diesel to electric cars is the ""zero emission vehicle mandate"", requiring a minimum percentage of manufacturers' new car and van sales to be zero emission from 2024.A new consultation document today sets out minimum sales targets. These would be 22% in 2024, increasing to 80% in 2030 and 100% in 2035.EV sales already reached 15% of new car sales in the year to June 2022, and the targets broadly track projected sales anyway, according to analysts. Some say the targets should be more ambitious in order to accelerate growth of the second-hand EV market, enabling more drivers to switch to electric.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerThe new Green Finance Strategy - developed by the Treasury, the new Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, and the environment department - sets out how the UK government intends to ensure green finance markets protect and boost the economy and deliver climate goals.The government has also increased the maximum exposure limit for UK Export Finance from £50bn to £60bn, creating extra capacity to boost exports, including from the UK's clean growth sectors.The government announced an extra £185m for cutting energy use in industry.The Confederation of British Industry said the various measures today represented a ""gear shift to boost energy security, reduce household bills and re-establish the UK's credentials as a leader in green technologies"".To meet an existing target to free Britain's heating system of gas, all homes will eventually have to get rid of their gas boilers. Many homes will install heat pumps instead, but uptake so far has been slow due to a lack of awareness and supply.Today the government pledged £30m to help boost manufacturing and supply of heat pumps in the UK - it has not yet confirmed if this is new or whether it comes out of a previously announced £1bn fund.And it is to consult on a heat pump sales mandate from 2024.It also extended an existing £5,000 grant to anyone buying a heat pump to 2028, under the Boiler Upgrade Scheme.However, the government did commit to rebalancing the ""current distortions in electricity and gas prices"" to ensure electricity is cheaper.The rebalance will ""help reduce the operating costs of heat pumps, electric vehicles and other low carbon technologies,"" said Sir John Armitt, chair of the National Infrastructure Commission. ""The sooner this can be achieved, the better.""Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerThe fact the government didn't aim higher on the millions of homes that need insulating amounts to an announcement of ""all padding and no substance"", said Cara Jenkinson, cities manager at climate solutions charity Ashden.The government steered clear of lifting a de facto ban on onshore wind, which could provide cheap power and is relatively quick to build, but is currently bogged down by onerous planning conditions.""The government still has not understood the priorities and urgency here,"" said Prof Richard Cochrane, associate professor in renewable energy at Exeter University. ""Onshore wind is the cheapest and quickest option"" to boost domestic energy security, he said.Be the first to get Install the Sky News app for freeThe government has so far made little mention of its ongoing licensing of new oil and gas fields in the North Sea, which experts say is at odds with climate targets. Rumours that the Rosebank oil field would be approved have not (yet) materialised.Nick Molho, who runs the Aldersgate Group of businesses and civil society groups, said ""significant gaps"" remained. ""Further policy detail in areas like home energy efficiency and heating, heavy industry and surface transport is urgently required to meet the challenge presented by increased global competition from the US and the EU, and attract the scale of private investment needed in the UK's low carbon infrastructure.""Plugging these outstanding policy gaps must be accompanied by the creation of a Net Zero Delivery Body as recommended by the Skidmore review.""

69,2023-04-02,Sky News,Orca Lolita may go free after 52 years in captivity at Miami Seaquarium | World News | Sky News,"Lolita, who has entertained Miami crowds for decades, is the second-oldest living killer whale after her mother, who is believed to be more than 90 years old.Friday 31 March 2023 14:58, UKAn orca may return to freedom in the Pacific Northwest after more than five decades in captivity entertaining crowds in the southern US state of Florida.Lolita - also known as Tokitae - was around four years old when she was captured in the summer of 1970 during a period of deadly orca roundups, and has since been based at the Miami Seaquarium.But an unlikely coalition formed involving the theme park's owner, Eduardo Albor, animal rights group Friends of Toki and NFL owner-philanthropist Jim Irsay.They announced plans to free Lolita in a news conference on Thursday.""I'm excited to be a part of Lolita's journey to freedom,"" Indianapolis Colts owner Mr Irsay said. ""I know Lolita wants to get to free waters.""Lolita was captured in 1970 in Puget Sound - an inlet of the Pacific Ocean located in the northwestern US state of Washington - and was bought by a Miami Seaquarium veterinarian for about $20,000 (£16,000).She performed for decades until last year when the theme park announced it would no longer stage shows with her in an agreement with government regulators.She is the second-oldest living orca whale after one called Ocean Sun, believed to be her mother, who continues to swim free with other members of their clan in the waters between Washington state and Canada.Ocean Sun is over 90 years old, which has given advocates for Lolita's release hope that she could live for many years to come in the wild.Lolita will not be freed immediately, however, with hurdles still to overcome.In a plan set to take up to two years, she will be transported by plane to an ocean sanctuary in the waters between Washington state and Canada where trainers and veterinarians will teach her how to catch fish inside a large net.She will also have to build up her muscles. Orcas typically swim around 100 miles (160 kilometres) per day, but she has been living in a tank that measures 24m by 11m and is 6m deep.""She was 4 when she was taken, so she was learning to hunt. She knows her family song,"" said Raynell Morris, an elder of the Lummi Indian Tribe in Washington who also serves on the board of Friends of Toki. ""She'll remember, but it will take time.""Lolita would remain under 24-hour care until she acclimatises to her new surroundings, and caretakers at the Seaquarium are already preparing her for the journey, officials said.The deadly whale roundups of the 1960s and 70s have had a lasting impact on a distinct group of endangered, salmon-eating orcas that are known as the ""southern resident killer whales"" and spend much of their time in the waters between Washington and Canada.The roundups reduced the population by around 40% - at least 13 orcas died during the roundup, while 45 were taken to theme parks.Just 73 remain in the southern residence population, which is made up of three ""pods"", according to the Centre for Whale Research. That's just two more animals than in 1971.Activist groups, including the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), have campaigned for many years for Lolita to be released into controlled setting, and protests often take plan along the road towards the Seaquarium.Eduardo Albor, owner of The Dolphin Company which operates the Miami Seaquarium, said one of the reasons his company purchased it in 2021 was to help Lolita.""It has always been our commitment at The Dolphin Company that we place the highest priority on the wellbeing of the animals above all else"" he added.""Finding a better future for Lolita is one of the reasons that motivated us to acquire the Miami Seaquarium.""Miami-Dade county mayor Daniella Levine Cava called the relocation plan historic.""So many have hoped and prayed for this result for many, many years,"" she said.

I'm not sure what else, but, to me, it should be looked at as a time capsule, not for what they did wrong.""The popular sitcom went on for 10 seasons between 1994-2004 and won many awards, including the Golden Globe for best performance and Emmy for outstanding comedy series.

They dug out social media posts showing him  in the years after the accident, despite him saying he was a different and damaged man because of the crash.Leaving court after the verdict, Paltrow approached Mr Sanderson, bent down and whispered in his ear: ""I wish you well.""It was difficult to see if she had gritted teeth but Mr Sanderson responded: ""Thank you, dear.""It seemed, at least, a cordial end to a seven-year-long legal tussle in and out of court.

                Once he was elected, Mr Trump reimbursed Mr Cohen by paying him more than double the original amount. He continued to deny the affair, however.New York investigators have been looking into the former president's finances for years - originally led by former District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr.But when he was replaced with Alvin Bragg in 2022, Mr Bragg decided to drop the grand jury investigation into claims the Trump empire fraudulently inflated its real estate value.Instead he decided to focus on the hush money case last summer, impanelling a grand jury (one assembled in secret to determine whether there's enough evidence to prosecute) in January.Soon after Mr Cohen, who was, was summoned by prosecutors.According to court documents, Mr Trump falsely listed his former lawyer's reimbursement as ""legal services"".It is not yet known what Mr Trump will be charged with.But among the options for prosecutors is an accounting fraud charge over the payment made to Mr Cohen.They could also decide to indict him on campaign fraud charges - as silencing Ms Daniels's claims could have helped propel him to power.Mr Trump has described the investigation as a politically motivated ""witch hunt"".

But what he carries in close support he drops in those more distant.The moderate Republicans and swing voters who turned their back on him in 2020, and at the recent mid-term elections, won't necessarily be turned round by a candidate who is criminally-adjacent on a number of fronts.Don't forget that this particular case is the least serious that he faces, compared with investigations into the January 6 insurrection, the handling of classified documents and alleged attempts to overturn the 2020 election result in the state of Georgia.Trump's claims of a political witch-hunt have found an echo among Republicans on Capitol Hill. Some of the party's House committee chairmen have called for the prosecuting district attorney, Alvin Bragg, to explain before Congress what they call ""a politically motivated prosecutorial decision"".It is the mood music that plays in parallel to this New York case and, they might hope, the others. If Donald Trump can shake it off - and a number of legal experts believe it will be difficult to prosecute - he will undoubtedly portray that as supporting evidence of an overall effort by a weaponised justice system to target him politically.Be the first to get Install the Sky News app for freeIt is the politics of justice and everyone, it seems, is having a say. In laying criminal charges, justice has begun to speak for itself.In the meantime, America lives through history as it happens.

When personal details are made public in court, as with Johnny Depp v Amber Heard, and the Wagatha Christie case, does anyone really win?
          Entertainment reporter
              
      Saturday 1 April 2023 03:18, UKGwyneth Paltrow consciously uncoupled from ordinary life years ago.In the era of celebrity relatability, with once mysterious A-listers now sharing everything from breakfast to breakdowns on social media, she is one star completely comfortable with the world knowing she exists on a higher plane of bone broth, vagina candles, and $8,000-a-day skiing lessons.Facing a lawsuit, many A-listers might simply choose to pay-up, regardless of whodunnit, rather than go through the rigmarole of a potentially reputation-damaging court case. But the Oscar-winner turned wellness guru is not one of them.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerThe internet has been flooded with  in the last two weeks, as her high-profile legal fight played out on camera. This all started with a skiing accident involving a retired optometrist in Utah in 2016, and somehow ended in global headlines about the star's outfits, controversy over her offer to hand out treats in the courtroom - declined! - and questioning about her friendship with .She  - only asking for $1 in damages, because this was about principle - but for a woman who would barely have noticed making it all go away for $300,000 (£242,000), the amount she was sued for, was it really worth it?Many were shocked hearing the details of the wealth and privilege that spilled out in court, but perhaps there were just as many impressed by her dry response when asked what she had lost as a result of the accident. ""Well, we lost half a day of skiing,"" quickly went viral. (Luckily, she was still able to get a massage.)And turning the courtroom into a catwalk for her own brand Goop, as well as other designers, no doubt has helped with sales.For some reason, celebrity lawsuits seem to be like buses at the moment. At the same time as Paltrow was in court in the US, here in the UK a group including ,  and  were taking on the publisher of the Daily Mail at the High Court; last year, we hadand .In 2020, when Depp first went to court in the UK - suing the publisher of The Sun newspaper - the revelations about his and Heard's relationship were jaw-dropping: ""mega pints"" of red wine, insults scrawled in blood and paint on walls, gross text messages, trashed apartments, human faeces apparently left in a bed... let alone the actual claims of abuse.Even before he lost the case, his reputation seemed to be ruined. But in 2022, he chose to go through it all again; this time suing Heard herself and, like Paltrow's case, all on camera. After following the UK case through news articles and bulletins, now the world was able to watch everything as it unfolded.Depp told the US court he lost ""nothing less than everything"" as a result of allegations of abuse by Heard. When asked why he had chosen the humiliation of his private life being publicly scrutinised over staying quiet, he said he was ""obsessed"" with the truth and wanted to clear his name for himself and for his children.After six weeks of evidence, the majority of the public seemed to side with the actor and the jury went the opposite way to the judge in the UK, finding in his favour.Before the verdict had even been delivered, , having joined Jeff Beck on his European tour. More gigs -  - followed in the days surrounding his legal win. Now, he is due to appear as Louis XV in Jeanne Du Barry, his first major film role since the court cases, later this year; his supergroup The Hollywood Vampires goes on tour in the summer, and there are reports he may even return to the Pirates franchise.For Depp, arguably it was all worth it. For Rebekah Vardy, who refused to back down in her lawsuit against Coleen Rooney despite a settlement being offered before the eventual court case, it probably wasn't.During the court hearing, it was alleged she had leaked stories to tabloids, not just about Rooney, but about teammates of her Leicester City footballer husband Jamie Vardy and others, and that she set up paparazzi shots of the England players' wives and girlfriends during the World Cup in Russia in 2018.In a damning verdict, Judge Justice Steyn described Vardy's evidence as ""manifestly inconsistent... evasive or implausible"" - while Rooney's evidence was ""honest and reliable"".Afterwards, Vardy maintained her innocence in an interview with TalkTV, saying: ""It feels like the judge just read what was written in the media and took on their narrative bias.""Be the first to get Install the Sky News app for freeStill, she seems to be moving on. Perhaps all publicity is good publicity, as long as you can afford the costly legal fees if things don't go your way. Her latest Instagram posts show her on the ski slopes herself; hopefully she's aware of the dangers.After Paltrow's win was read out in court, the claimant, Terry Sanderson - who has to pay the star's legal fees, as well as his own, despite the minimal $1 damages - was questioned by reporters waiting outside. Asked if the trial had been ""worth it"", he replied: ""Absolutely not.""For Paltrow, perhaps it was. She has faced years of stick about her wellness brand, but has never cared about the haters. And long after the point of this case has been forgotten, the outfits - and no doubt visits to the Goop website - will live on.

The Manhattan district attorney's investigation centred on accusations of money paid to Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal, whom Trump allegedly feared would go public with claims they had extramarital sexual encounters with him.Trump, 76, has denied having affairs with either woman.His former personal lawyer Michael Cohen said he co-ordinated with Trump on the payments to Daniels, real name Stephanie Clifford, and also to McDougal.Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations in 2018 related to the payments and served more than a year in prison.Federal prosecutors said Cohen acted at Trump's direction.Trump said: ""The Democrats have lied, cheated and stolen in their obsession with trying to 'Get Trump,' but now they've done the unthinkable - indicting a completely innocent person in an act of blatant election interference.""""Never before in our nation's history has this been done.""He added: ""I believe this witch-hunt will backfire massively on Joe Biden.""Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerTrump was expected to surrender to authorities next week.He has denied any wrongdoing and has repeatedly attacked the investigation by district attorney Alvin Bragg.His office has spent nearly five years investigating Trump and the grand jury has been hearing its evidence since January.According to Mr Bragg's spokesperson prosecutors and Trump's legal team are now negotiating a surrender date, when the former leader would have to go to the district attorney's office in New York to be fingerprinted and photographed before an initial court appearance.Be the first to get Install the Sky News app for freeOn Twitter, one of Trump's sons, Eric, wrote: ""This is third world prosecutorial misconduct.

          News reporter
              
      Friday 31 March 2023 12:33, UKDonald Trump is expected to surrender himself to authorities after being indicted on criminal charges related to alleged hush money paid to an adult film actress.Here we take a look at the key figures in , which could result in the first-ever criminal prosecution of a former US president.The porn actress was paid $130,000 (£105,000) to keep quiet about what she described as an awkward and unexpected sexual encounter with Trump at a celebrity golf outing in Lake Tahoe in 2006.The former US president denies having had sex with her., whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, was paid the money in the final weeks of Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.It came after her representative said she was willing to make on-the-record statements to the National Enquirer tabloid newspaper or on television confirming a sexual encounter with Trump.Ms McDougal is a former Playboy model who said she had a 10-month affair with Trump in the mid-2000s.She was paid $150,000 (£121,000) in 2016 by the parent company of the National Enquirer for the rights to her story about the alleged relationship.The story never ran after the newspaper supressed it until after the election.American Media Inc has acknowledged that its payments to Ms McDougal were done specifically to assist Trump's election bid and were made ""in concert"" with his campaign.The former president denies any affair. is a lawyer by training who worked for the Trump Organisation from 2006 to 2017 and served as the former president's fixer.He once proudly proclaimed he would ""take a bullet"" for Trump.Cohen took the lead in arranging the payment to Ms Daniels, passing it through a corporation he established for the purpose.He says he was then reimbursed by Trump, whose company logged the payment and related bonuses as ""legal expenses"".A few months earlier, Cohen had also arranged for the publisher of the National Enquirer to make the similar $150,000 payment to Ms McDougal for the rights to her story about an alleged affair with Trump.Cohen made recordings of a conversation in which he and Trump spoke about the arrangement to pay Ms McDougal through the tabloid publisher.At one point, Trump said: ""What do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?""The long-time chief financial officer at the Trump Organisation, Mr Weisselberg made key decisions in how the company kept its books, but did not appear to be cooperating with the hush money investigation.During testimony before Congress in 2019, Cohen said it was Mr Weisselberg who decided how to structure his reimbursement for the payment to Ms Daniels. Cohen said Weisselberg paid the money out over 12 months ""so that it would look like a retainer"".Federal prosecutors gave Weisselberg limited immunity from prosecution in exchange for his grand jury testimony in their investigation of the payments.Mr Pecker is the National Enquirer's former publisher and a long-time friend of Trump's.He met with Cohen during Trump's 2016 campaign and said the Enquirer's parent company would help buy and bury potentially damaging stories about Trump's relationship with women.Mr Pecker, who was the Enquirer's chairman and chief executive at the time, agreed to keep Cohen apprised of any such stories. In June 2016, he alerted Cohen that Ms McDougal's lawyer had approached the publication seeking to sell her story about an alleged affair with Trump.The Enquirer's owner at the time, American Media Inc, then agreed to pay Ms McDougal $150,000 for ""limited life rights"" to the story of her alleged relationship with the former president.Federal prosecutors decided in 2018 not to prosecute American Media in exchange for its cooperation in the campaign finance investigation that led to Cohen's guilty plea and prison sentence.Manhattan's first black district attorney, Mr Bragg could become the first prosecutor anywhere to bring a criminal case against a former US president.The Democrat inherited an investigation of Trump when he took office in January 2022.Mr Bragg grew up in Harlem during the 1980s crack cocaine epidemic, where he says he was held at gunpoint six times - three times by police.A graduate of Harvard Law School, he previously worked as a federal prosecutor, chief deputy state attorney general, civil rights lawyer and law school professor.A Brooklyn-born lawyer known for his sharp suits and celebrity clientele, Mr Tacopina is the public face of Trump's defence team.Trump is just the latest big name to turn to Mr Tacopina, whose past clients have included the rappers Meek Mill, Jay-Z and A$AP Rocky and baseball great Alex Rodriguez.In recent weeks, Mr Tacopina has been making the former president's case on TV news shows, questioning Mr Bragg's investigation and motives, challenging Cohen's credibility as a star witness and suggesting Trump was extorted.But before he started representing Trump, he had previously said the payment to Ms Daniels appeared to be ""illegal"" and a ""potential campaign finance issue"".Ms Necheles is a New York City defence lawyer who represented Trump's company at its tax fraud trial last year and has been working behind the scenes on the former president's criminal defence, meeting with prosecutors in an attempt to head off potential charges.In the past she served as counsel to the late Genovese crime family underboss Venero Mangano, known as Benny Eggs, and defended John Gotti's lawyer, Bruce Cutler, in a contempt of court case in the early 1990s.Mr Bragg hired Mr Colangelo in December to lead the investigation.They previously worked together on Trump-related matters as senior officials at the office of New York attorney general Letitia James.During his tenure with the attorney general's office, Mr Colangelo worked on a lawsuit that resulted in the closure of Trump's charitable foundation for misusing funds.He was also part of a wave of state litigation against Trump administration policies, resulting in dozens of lawsuits that challenged everything from diluted environmental standards to changes to US mail service ahead of the 2020 election.

He has urged his social media followers to protest against his arrest, sparking fears of violence similar to the Capitol Riots.The 15th floor, where else?As information dripped out around Donald Trump’s court appearance, it emerged he’ll appear in the same courtroom as Harvey Weinstein. Trump will learn of the charges against him in the room where the film executive was convicted of rape and sexual assault in 2020.There’ll be other cases heard within the court on the 15th floor that aren’t sordid - that one, and this one, aren’t among them.So, the Trump case that has a one night stand with a porn star at its heart will commence at 2.15pm next Tuesday, in the room on the 15th floor.He won’t be in handcuffs, that much has been established between the district attorney and Trump’s lawyers.  It’s a break with normal procedure in these circumstances - in these unprecedented circumstances, there is a choreography being pulled together ‘on the hoof’ by sets of lawyers who have no drawings to work from. The full details around Trump’s appearance will only become clear as they happen. In the meantime, the mood music from Team Trump is defiantly upbeat, outwardly at least.Alina Habba, a lawyer for the former President, told us: “he's doing well. It's not surprising for me. Very well. He's resilient and strong, and of course, not happy with the news of the indictment. But ready to fight, I would say.”With one case on the books and three in the pipeline, he’ll need to be.On Tuesday next week former president Donald Trump will be formally arraigned in his hush money case.Speaking to Sky News this evening, Joseph Cosgrove, former judge of the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania, has said he assumes there will be ""some accommodation"" made because Trump is a former president.However, he will be processed ""just like any other criminal"".He said: ""He will be finger printed, he will have his mugshot taken and then he will be marched a few blocks away to appear before the judge who will just do something very simple - ask him if he understands the nature of the charges against him and understands that he has a right to remain silent.""He will also be advised that he has the right to counsel and if he cannot afford counsel one will be appointed for him.""Mr Cosgrove said Trump will be released on ""some sort of bail condition"" and most likely told where he will appear  He added it will be a ""simple brief process"" and it is expected the judge will handle it formally.We reported earlier that Donald Trump will be arraigned on Tuesday afternoon at a Manhattan court.He faces around 30 counts of document fraud-related charges in the indictment, according to two sources, but the indictment itself has remained sealed.Sources have now told CNN that the former president is expected to be arraigned at around 2.15pm New York time (7.15pm GMT).Stormy Daniels had been due to do an interview with Talk TV's Piers Morgan tonight.However, in the last few moments Morgan has said the interview has been postponed due to ""some security issues"".The US is ""turning into a banana republic"" and the country is losing its status, Liz Harrington, a spokesperson for Donald Trump, has told Sky News.She said Trump was ""doing good"" and ""knew he had done nothing wrong"".However, he was ""concerned"" for the US because ""this was totally baseless"", she added.She said: ""He has been under baseless investigations for seven years now and he always comes out more clean on the other side because the truth is on his side.""She said his team were ""ready for anything"" and called the investigation ""corrupt"".""This cannot happen in a great country like ours and we are losing our status as a great nation and we are turning into a banana republic,"" she added.She went on to say the case against Trump showed the justice system in the US was ""not a legitimate"" one.Wearing MAGA (Make America Great Again) clothing and waving Trump flags, backers of Donald Trump have been gathering outside his Mar-a-Lago estate to show their support.In the first criminal case against a former president, Trump has been indicted on charges involving payments made during the 2016 campaign to allegedly silence claims of an extramarital sexual encounter.Trump, who is running for the White House again in 2024, called the decision by a Manhattan grand jury to indict him ""political persecution and election interference at the highest level"".We have been reporting throughout the day on porn actress Stormy Daniels who is at the centre of the case against Donald Trump.Ms Daniels was paid $130,000 to keep quiet about what she says was an awkward and unexpected sexual encounter with Mr Trump in 2006. Mr Trump denies having sex with Ms Daniels.Mr Trump has also described the investigation as a politically motivated ""witch hunt"".Here, we take a look at the porn actress who could face Trump in court...We reported earlier that President Joe Biden had been asked about the indictment against his predecessor in the White House.Asked three times for a comment on the case against Donald Trump, the president said repeatedly: ""I have no comment on Trump.""The White House has now said that Mr Biden and other White House officials found out about the New York indictment through news reports.White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters that Mr Biden's chief of staff told him of the reports.She declined to comment further.The New York Post, one of the city's daily newspapers and among the largest in the US, has gone with a pun in its front page coverage of the Trump indictment today.Trump's expected appearance before a judge in Manhattan on Tuesday comes as the Republican mounts a comeback bid for the presidency.A New York judge today authorised Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg to make the charges public, but it is not clear when he will do so.The charges facing Donald Trump is ""vindication"" and shows he is ""no longer untouchable"", Stormy Daniels has said.In an interview with , the porn actress, whose birth name is Stephanie Clifford, said the case, which is a US first, was ""monumental and epic"" and she was ""proud"".However, she stressed it was ""going to continue to divide people and bring them up in arms"".She said: ""He's done so much worse that he should have been taken down [for] before.""Speaking from an undisclosed location in the US, Ms Daniels said that within hours of the indictment, she had started receiving threats of violence.She also said it was ""especially scary because Trump himself is inciting violence and encouraging it"".Despite the increasing threats, she said she was not fearful of facing Trump in court.""I've seen him naked. There's no way he could be scarier with his clothes on,"" she added. Ms Daniels has not yet been officially called to give evidence against Trump, but she has stressed she is ""not afraid"".""I have nothing to hide, and I look forward to telling everybody what I know,"" she said.: The case against him centres on a $130,000 (£105,000) payment made to porn actress Stormy Daniels during the final days of the 2016 presidential campaign.Ms Daniels claims she had an affair with Mr Trump in 2006, which the former US president denies.In 2016 when he was running for president, she offered to sell her story to the press.Mr Trump's then-lawyer Michael Cohen was notified of her plans, resulting in a $130,000 (£105,000) payment being made to keep Ms Daniels quiet.Once he was elected, Mr Trump reimbursed Mr Cohen by paying him more than double the original amount.

      Sunday 2 April 2023 09:27, UKScientists have set a new record for the deepest fish ever caught on camera - as well as the deepest catch ever made.The juvenile fish - a type of snailfish - was filmed swimming at 8,336m (27,349ft) in the Izu-Ogasawara Trench, south of .The previous record - also a snailfish - was recorded at 8,178m (26,839ft) in the Pacific's Mariana Trench in 2017.The Mariana Trench is home to the deepest point in any sea on earth at a maximum depth of approximately 10,935m (35,876ft).But scientists leading the research in the Izu-Ogasawara Trench believe their discovery could be at - or close to - the maximum depth any fish can survive.Professor Alan Jamieson, who is a researcher at the University of Western in Perth, said he believes the fish can live at such depths in the Izu-Ogasawara Trench because of its slightly warmer waters.He said: ""We have spent over 15 years researching these deep snailfish; there is so much more to them than simply the depth, but the maximum depth they can survive is truly astonishing.""""In other trenches such as the Mariana Trench, we were finding them at increasingly deeper depths just creeping over that 8,000m mark in fewer and fewer numbers, but around Japan they are really quite abundant.""Though the fish filmed by researchers were not caught to be fully identified, scientists did trap snailfish slightly higher up at 8,022m (26,318ft) - another record.Snailfish are found in oceans across the world, with more than 300 different species currently known, many of which live in shallow waters.They are described as being tadpole-like in shape, with larger heads and slender bodies.The species adapted to living in deeper waters can withstand the huge deep-sea pressure with the help of their gelatinous bodies.Professor Jamieson, who is the founder of the Minderoo-UWA Deep Sea Research Centre, worked with a team from the Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology on the two-month expedition, which began in September last year.Be the first to get Install the Sky News app for freeThe expedition, which also involved looking at the Ryukyu trench, along the southeastern edge of Japan's Ryukyu Islands, is part of a 10-year study into the deepest fish populations in the world.

101,2023-04-02,Sky News,Oscars 2023: Diversity v data - what analysis of 94 years of winners tells us about the Academy Awards | Ents & Arts News | Sky News,"Hollywood has for years been known as a straight, white boys' club where the issue of diversity has long been a problem. Awards ceremonies, particularly the , are where it is all laid bare.In a time of significant upheaval in the industry, the wheels have been turning, albeit slowly.The #OscarsSoWhite, Time's Up and #MeToo movements have pushed the issues to the fore and over the past few years there has been more debate than ever, with representation of LGBTQ+ and disabled actors being highlighted, too.Following criticism in 2015 and 2016, a record seven actors from minority groups were nominated in 2017. And on the night, Moonlight - an LGBTQ+ film with an all-black cast - triumphed over La La Land (after that infamous  on stage). But the Academy faced criticism once again for  in its nominations for the 2020 ceremony - with Harriet actress Cynthia Erivo the only non-white acting nominee and no female directors. When it came to the ceremony itself, all the acting winners were white.Korean film Parasite made history as the first foreign language film to take the night's big prize, the best picture award - as well as the gongs for best director, original screenplay, production design, editing and international feature film - Academy members starting to realise there is a world for film outside Hollywood.Over the past few years, the Academy has significantly expanded its voting body, inviting hundreds of new members. This seems to have made a real difference.In 2022, Jane Campion was named best director, for Power Of The Dog, a year on from Chloe Zhao picking up the prize for Nomadland; two female directors in a row, but only the second and third women in Oscars history to take home the gong - after Kathryn Bigelow, for The Hurt Locker, in 2010. Born in China, Zhao was also the first woman from an ethnically diverse background to win the award.In the acting categories in 2021, only one of the four winners was American, with previous winner Frances McDormand awarded the best actress gong for Nomadland. British stars Sir Anthony Hopkins (The Father) and Daniel Kaluuya (Judas And The Black Messiah) took home the best actor and best supporting actor prizes respectively, while South Korean actress Youn Yuh-jung was named best supporting actress for Minari.In 2022, the acting awards went to four American stars: Will Smith (we won't get into slapgate here), deaf actor Troy Kotsur, Jessica Chastain and Ariana DeBose.According to several studies in recent years, films and television shows produced by major media firms have long been whitewashed, and there has been an ""epidemic of invisibility"" for women, minorities and LGBTQ+ people. In the past few years there has been much talk around the topic of inclusion, but is real change now on the horizon?Sky News has analysed 94 years of the winners in the main Oscars categories - here's how the stats add up.It is no secret that for years, women had a much shorter shelf life than men in Hollywood.Actresses have long been calling for more roles for older women, for more films to be made for women, and to play more than just the love interest.For women, youth has always been prized; for men, the lines around the eyes traditionally rewarded. In 2021, at the age of 83 years and 115 days, Sir Anthony became the oldest ever best actor winner. At 63, McDormand became the third oldest best actress winner - but is still 20 years his junior.However, the supporting categories that year bucked the trend, with Kaluuya aged 32 and Yuh-jung aged 73. Both made it into the age history books for their categories - Kaluuya in the top 10 youngest ever winners, Yuh-jung the top 10 oldest ever winners.In 2022, Smith and Kotsur (both 53 at the time) were older than the female acting winners, with Chastain aged 45 and DeBose, 31.However, in the past six years, the gap has closed considerably, with the average age for male winners between 2017 and 2022 working out at 50 - exactly the same as the average age for the female acting winners in that period. It will be interesting to see if this continues in future years.Our analysis shows that since the Academy Awards began, Oscar-winning actresses are on average eight years younger than their male counterparts. This gap has closed from an average of nine years in 2020.The average male winner is 47, the average female winner is 39.The difference is greatest in the supporting actor and actress categories, where on average men are nine years older than the women.The youngest woman to win the leading actress award is Marlee Matlin, who was 22 when she received the prize for Children Of A Lesser God in 1987.Up until last year, she was the only deaf performer to ever have won an Academy Award. However, Kotsur's win for his performance in CODA - which also went on to win best picture - made him the second.The youngest man to win the leading actor prize is Adrien Brody, who was named the winner for his role in The Pianist in 2003, aged 30.Until Hopkins' win, the oldest winners actually bucked the trend; Jessica Tandy received the honour at the age of 81 in 1991, for Driving Miss Daisy, while Henry Fonda - who had held the record for 39 years - was 77 when he won for his role in Golden Pond in 1982.But Tandy and Fonda were the exception to the rule.Just 29 women aged 40 or over have ever won the leading actress award, compared with 63 men named leading actor.At the other end of the chart, Brody remains the only actor under the age of 30 to have won the award, compared with 32 actresses.In the supporting categories, 42 women aged 40 or over have won the award, compared with 68 men.Seventeen women under 30 have won the prize, compared with just four men.Interestingly, in the last decade the age of female winners has been increasing and we can see a trend rising up.In 2018, McDormand won the best actress award for her role in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, then aged 61, and got all the female nominees standing during her rousing acceptance speech.Of course, half of the acting winners have to be women. But when you look at all the other groups, which aren't split into male and female categories, the disparity is stark.Female screenwriters make up less than 10% of the winners over the years.And in 94 years of Academy Awards winners there have only ever been three women to win the award for best director – Kathryn Bigelow, for The Hurt Locker, in 2010, and now Zhao and Campion.In 2021, Zhao and Promising Young Woman director Emerald Fennell were the first female directors to be nominated since 2018, when Greta Gerwig was shortlisted for Lady Bird.This was despite strong contenders such as Marielle Heller (Can You Ever Forgive Me?), Lynne Ramsay (You Were Never Really Here) and Josie Rourke (Mary Queen Of Scots) in 2019; and Lulu Wang (The Farewell), Heller again (A Beautiful Day In The Neighborhood), Gerwig again (Little Women), Lorene Scarfaria (Hustlers) and Alma Har'el (Honey Boy) in 2020.This year, there are no female directors nominated once again.In 2016, for the second year running, no actors from ethnically diverse communities were nominated in either the leading or supporting categories, sparking the #OscarsSoWhite backlash.It was not before time.         In all four acting categories, plus directing and screenwriting, only 55 Oscar wins have been for people from ethnically diverse backgrounds - although you can see change has begun, with half of these wins in the last decade.Seven of these winners have received more than one: Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu has three, while Ang Lee, Anthony Quinn, Denzel Washington, Alfonso Cuaron, Mahershala Ali and Bong Joon-ho have two.The late Sidney Poitier was the first black man to win the Oscar for leading actor, for Lilies Of The Field, in 1964 - 35 years after the awards began.The second was Denzel Washington, for Training Day, almost 40 years later. Until Smith in 2022, the last black man to win the Oscar for best actor in a leading role was Forest Whitaker, for The Last King Of Scotland, in 2006; the last person of colour was Rami Malek, for Bohemian Rhapsody, in 2019.For black women, the statistics are even more shocking.Halle Berry's win in 2002, for her role in Monster's Ball, was monumental. After 73 years of the Oscars, she was the first black woman to receive the Oscar for best leading actress.Twenty-one years later, she remains the only one. With no black actresses nominated in 2023 - Viola Davis and Danielle Deadwyler among the notable omissions - that statistic is not going to change this year.In 2017, Mahershala Ali became the first Muslim actor to win an Oscar, for best supporting actor for his role in Moonlight. He later added to that with his second supporting actor win for Green Book in 2019.In the best director category, Ang Lee became the first Asian nominee to win the award, for Brokeback Mountain in 2006.In 2020, the directing prize went to Parasite's Bong Joon-ho.The 2021 shortlist featured the most diverse nominations ever, with nine of the 20 actors in the running from ethnically diverse backgrounds.For the first time in Oscars history, the majority of nominees for best leading actor were not white - with Sound Of Metal's Riz Ahmed, Minari's Steven Yeun and the late Chadwick Boseman, for Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, up against Hopkins and Gary Oldman (Mank).And in the directing category, Minari's Lee Isaac Chung was also shortlisted alongside Zhao, als well as Thomas Vinterberg (Another Round), David Fincher (Mank), and Fennell.This year's shortlist features six actors from ethnically diverse backgrounds among the 20 in the running.It will be no surprise to hear that Oscar winners are overwhelmingly American.Some 553 awards in the seven categories analysed went to Americans,  which is almost three-quarters (74%) of the total since 1929.Brits come second, but with just 96 wins (13%).Only France and Italy also make double figures, with 12 and 11 awards respectively. Canada and Australia have nine, while Mexico has nine.Katharine Hepburn holds the title for most wins, having picked up four best actress Oscars over almost 50 years, for Morning Glory (1934), Guess Who's Coming To Dinner (1968), The Lion In Winter (1969) and On Golden Pond (1982).Daniel Day-Lewis has three awards for best actor - for My Left Foot (1990), There Will Be Blood (2008) and Lincoln (2013); McDormand also has three for best actress - for Nomadland (2021), Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2018) and Fargo (1997).Meryl Streep is the record-holder for the most nominations, with a whopping 21, and also equals Day-Lewis and McDormand with three wins - best actress for Sophie's Choice (1983) and The Iron Lady (2012), and best supporting actress for Kramer vs Kramer (1980). Jack Nicholson, Ingrid Bergman and Walter Brennan also have three wins each.Of the British winners, just seven have won more than one award. They are:Elizabeth Taylor - best actress for Butterfield 8 (1961) and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1967)Glenda Jackson - best actress for Women In Love (1971) and A Touch Of Class (1974)Maggie Smith - best actress for The Prime Of Miss Jean Brodie (1970) and best supporting actress for California Suite (1979)Michael Caine - best supporting actor for Hannah And Her Sisters (1987) and The Cider House Rules (2000)Peter Ustinov - best supporting actor for Spartacus (1961) and Topkapi (1965)Vivien Leigh - best actress for Gone With The Wind (1940) and A Streetcar Named Desire (1952)Anthony Hopkins - best actor for The Silence Of The Lambs (1992) and The Father (2021)Words: Gemma PeplowData: Carmen Aguilar Garcia, Ganesh Rao and Saywah MahmoodDesign: Brian Gillingham

108,2023-04-02,Sky News,"Iran: The fight for 'Women, Life, Freedom' carries on underground | World News | Sky News","As a little girl growing up in the Islamic Republic of Iran, I dreamed of becoming a man - it seemed the only way to be free. I can't pinpoint a specific moment when that thought began, but I do recall a particularly hot summer's afternoon. I was nine years old, and had travelled with my family to a seaside village called Chamkhaleh, in the north of Iran.We went there every year. Swimming in the Caspian Sea and making sand castles on its beautiful beaches were among my favourite pastimes, but this summer was different.In Iran, when girls turn nine, they are legally considered to have entered womanhood and are required to follow a series of restrictive rules, written by men. The most symbolic of these is possibly the mandatory wearing of the hijab.That year, my mum sat me down and explained that if I wanted to get in the sea I had to go in fully covered. That meant wearing a pair of jeans, a long-sleeved top, and a loose covering called a mantou. My hair also had to be covered in a thick headscarf. Just like all the other ""women"".I felt imprisoned by these layers as I entered the water. The morality police were stationed on the beach, making sure that I wasn't showing too much hair or skin to - ""god forbid"" - arouse the men. Their watchful eyes made me feel dirty, and somehow guilty.Then I found myself in water that was far too deep. As the tide pulled me out, I felt weighed down by my now-heavy clothes. I gasped for air, but my scarf covered my face. I screamed for help but perhaps the loud engines of the morality police's motorbikes drowned out my voice.I woke up on the beach, coughing up water and shivering. My dad had noticed me struggling and rushed in to get me out, just in time. That was the last time I ever set foot in my beloved Caspian Sea.Sahar's primary school card shows her aged sixSahar's primary school card shows her aged sixGrowing up in Iran, I felt like I was drowning every single day. My voice, my skin, my thoughts, my soul - everything had to be veiled. Women in Iran are second-class citizens. They are oppressed under discriminatory laws, based on religion, in almost all aspects of life from marriage to inheritance and even travel. They're banned from riding bicycles in public, having sex outside of marriage, and even entering sport stadiums, where men are present. They also have no legal protection against domestic violence and sexual harassment. Sahar with her mum, dad and baby sister by the Caspian SeaSahar with her mum, dad and baby sister by the Caspian SeaThe only way out, for those who have the means, is to embark on dangerous journeys to places far from home.At the age of 12, along with my mother and baby sister, I escaped. After years at the mercy of people smugglers, sleeping rough and living in various refugee camps across Europe, we found safe haven in the UK.  For my friends and family who stayed behind, freedom was a concept they hardly dared dream of.WOMEN, LIFE, FREEDOMThen last September, everything changed. The death of Mahsa Amini, 22, in the custody of the ""morality police"" became a spark that ignited the largest anti-regime protests in the 43-year history of the Islamic Republic.Mahsa Amini Pic: Center for Human Rights in IranMahsa Amini Pic: Center for Human Rights in IranWomen and girls defied the morality laws by publicly removing their hijab, some burning them in bonfires. The chant of ""women, life, freedom"" became the slogan of the unrest. Fuelled by frustration at the overzealous policing of oppressive laws and the country’s declining economy, tens of thousands of people joined the protests, demanding social freedom, political change, and liberation from the Islamic Republic's theocracy. Around the world, crowds gathered to show solidarity with the movement and express their anger at Mahsa Amini's killing.Protests against the Iranian government spread to LondonProtests against the Iranian government spread to LondonSupreme leader Ali Khamenei, Iran's spiritual leader, who also has the final say over all government matters, has portrayed the protests as riots backed by ""foreign enemies out to overthrow the regime"".In response, furious crowds chanted ""death to the dictator"" and ""death to Khamenei"". Such ""blasphemy"", punishable by death, would have been unimaginable before. I remember in school being made to chant ""death to America, the UK and Israel"", and being taught that Khamenei was chosen by ""Allah"" so any insult towards him was an insult towards God. In an attempt to crush the protests, the Iranian authorities cut off access to the internet, but tech-savvy Iranians soon found new ways of getting their message to the outside world.500 PROTESTERS KILLEDInside Iran, among my friends and family, there was shock at how widespread the unrest was. Almost everyone witnessed some form of violence towards the protesters or knew someone who had been arrested. Whether or not they dared to join the demonstrations on the streets, everyone seemed emboldened, daring to believe that change could be possible.  The authoritarian system that governs Iran was born out of a populist revolution in 1979. Its entire structure is based on not being overthrown in the same way. Determined to cling to power at any cost, the government instituted a brutal crackdown.According to Iran Human Rights (IHR) and other rights groups, in 2022 more than 500 people, including 70 minors, were killed by the regime. IHR reports this as being the ""highest rate in five years"".The Iranian regime has also executed at least four people for crimes connected to the unrest, which it insists has little to do with Mahsa Amini's death.Among those who lost their lives in the protests was 16-year-old Nika Shakarami, shown singing in the above video. Iran's chief of police said she fell to her death from a high building. This claim is disputed by the teenager's mother, who insists Nika was killed by blows to her head as punishment for taking part.University student Hamidreza Rouhi, 19, was shot dead while demonstrating. His last Instagram post reads: ""If the internet gets shut down forever, I want this to be my last post: Long live women, Long live freedom, Long live Iran.""One of the youngest victims was nine-year-old Kian Pirfalak (shown below with his mother) who, in videos published by his family on social media, said he dreamed of becoming a robotics engineer. Amid violent protests, he was shot by attackers on motorcycles while in a car with his father on their way home. His father was seriously injured but survived.""The government is killing us in our hundreds in an attempt to persuade the world it didn't kill Mahsa Amini,"" was a phrase I heard a lot around this time. Six months on, at least outwardly, life appears to have returned to normal. Public demonstrations are less frequent and, when they do happen, smaller in size and intensity. The 22,000 demonstrators who were arrested - many of whom faced physical, psychological and sexual torture while in custody - have recently been pardoned. But as the Islamic Republic prepares to celebrate its national day on 1 April, the flames of protest still flicker below the surface. Protesters are regrouping, finding new ways of resisting and asking themselves if they’re prepared, like Mahsa Amini, to pay the ultimate price for freedom. A woman protests against Iran's regime during a rally in front of the Iranian embassy in MadridA woman protests against Iran's regime during a rally in front of the Iranian embassy in Madrid""The protests in Iran have changed form,"" says Omid Shams, a UK-based human rights lawyer who has been documenting human rightsviolationsduring the protests. He points to the anti-government graffiti that is still splashed across walls all over the country. Every time those defiant slogans are wiped clean, they reappear within days.Part of the reason the initial wave has subsided, says Mr Shams, was a lack of leadership and a clear plan of action. The unrest continues, albeit more hidden than before. In the evenings, the now familiar chant of ""women, life, freedom"" still echoes from apartment windows. And public banners glorifying the Islamic Republic's leaders are defaced and destroyed.These are still punishable offences, but not as risky as gathering on the streets. Social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok and Twitter, which protesters are accessing illegally, have become another battlefield, with photos and videos that cross the regime's rigid boundaries regularly uploaded.The latest video to go viral was posted on TikTok on 8 March to mark International Women's Day. In defiance of the country's modesty laws, five teenage girls danced to Calm Down by Rema and Selena Gomez without headscarves and wearing crop tops.According to @shahrak_ekbatan, their neighbourhood Twitter account, the teenagers were later detained by security forces. They were made to delete the video and replace it with a new one, where they appear wearing headscarves and loose clothing, expressing remorse, saying ""they'd made a mistake"". In response, women and girls in Iran, and abroad, have started sharing videos of themselves following the same dance routine without head coverings. ""People can't stay out on the streets forever,"" explains Mahmood*, a twenty-something who has been part of the movement since the start. ""We demonstrated for 100 days straight. Now it's time to try something new.""Mahmood has paid the price for his part in the protests. He was seriously injured when police broke up a demonstration. As he was running away, a motorbike caught up with him. His next memory is the sound of gunshots and feeling a sharp, burning pain in his body, as if he was being ""electrocuted"". X-rays later revealed he had 250 shotgun pellets buried in his back.Mahmood conceals his face and voice on video callsMahmood has paid the price for taking part in protests""A revolution isn't going to happen in just a couple of months,"" says Sara*, a 21-year-old university student. ""Big changes require more time and planning.""Mahmood tells me that people are taking down CCTV cameras and ""planning other forms of heavier attacks"".As part of the crackdown, there have been reports of Iran’s security forces systematically targeting protesters' eyes and genitals. Hundreds of protesters, many verified by Mr Shams's team, have reported being blinded so far.Mahmood still has over 200 pellets in his backMahmood still has over 200 pellets in his back""I live in fear of being identified as a protester,"" says Mahmood, who still has more than 200 gunshot pellets in his back after being operated on for four hours. ""I can't go through any metal detecting gates at shopping centres or airports."" Among the protesters who have been caught, there have been a series of forced confessions, hasty trials and four public executions. Dozens of others, including some minors, were given the death sentence.Iran is one of the last countries in the world where juvenile offenders can be executed, with the age of legal responsibility only nine years old for girls, compared with 15 for boys. The international community has failed Iranians, says Mr Shams, by not taking real action to hold the regime accountable. But none of the protesters I've spoken to are convinced the regime has won. Sara points out that protests are happening at more regular intervals.There was the 2009 ""Green Movement"" which started in the wake of the June presidential election and lasted until early 2010. It was sparked by allegations of rigged ballots in favour of the then-president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Former Iranian president Mahmoud AhmadinejadPresident Mahmoud AhmadinejadIts supporters adopted the colour green as a symbol of hope and democracy. Despite its initial momentum, the Green Movement failed to bring about significant change in Iran's political system, and many of its leaders were forced into exile.Then in November 2019, an increase in fuel prices sparked a series of protests across more than 100 cities and towns. Demonstrators called for economic reforms, an end to government corruption and greater political freedom. The Iranian government responded with a violent crackdown, resulting in hundreds of deaths and thousands of arrests.Mahmood echoes this view: ""The poor, rich, middle class, whatever your gender, sexuality, ethnicity or religion, we are all now fighting against a common enemy.""There are four million university students in Iran, and the majority of them are young women. They have been a driving force in this movement from the start, organising protests and creating attention-grabbing art installations to express their anger and publicise the movement on social media. Now, many believe they are fuelling its survival. In this installation on a university campus red paint is used to depict bloodUniversity students have been creating attention-grabbing art installationsRaha*, a 21-year-old student in Tehran, tells me that universities are more closely monitoring whether or not students are wearing their hijabs, and threatening them with suspension if they flout the rules. ""The people protesting now are much fewer than before,"" Sara, another university student, says. ""It makes me feel like I'm alone.""Graffiti on a university wall in Tehran some of which reads: ""death to Khamenei"", ""#Mahsa_Amin"", ""Woman, Life, Freedom.""Graffiti on a university wall in TehranLike Mahmood, Sara has been physically attacked during the protests. She was beaten with a baton, hit by tear gas, and even shot at. She also received several threatening calls from the ""security police"", warning her against taking part in more protests. Recently, her parents have started receiving these calls too, which has made her more cautious.But Mahmood, Raha and Sara are determined to keep fighting for change. A LASTING LEGACYFor many women in Iran, change is already evident in their own lives.Young Iranian women are challenging behaviour within their own families, says Raha, like the unfair advantages given to their brothers, and the pressure to dress and act ""modestly"". Some are even standing up against domestic violence.  Women across the world cut their hair in solidarity with Iranian womenWomen across the world cut their hair in solidarity with Iranian women""In the Islamic Republic of Iran, people's lives have no value,"" says Mahmood. ""But you can't keep scaring people forever. Every time you try, they come back braver than before."" For him, there is only one way forward, and that is revolution. Mr Shams stresses the need for the world to stay focused on Iran, and keep applying pressure on the regime. Street demonstrations may have eased for now, but displays of public defiance and discontent remain. As the regime tries to conceal these traces of disobedience, the protesters' calls for an end to the dictatorship are intensifying underground.I have been a British citizen longer than I was in Iran, and have often felt detached from my home country. Sahar ZandSahar ZandBut for the first time in my life, I am proud to call myself an Iranian woman. And I am finally hopeful that perhaps, in a future not so far away, there will be a route to freedom in Iran other than being born a man.CREDITS Lucia Binding Serena Kutchinsky Karla Gowlett, Associated Press, Center for Human Rights in Iran Sabina Ullah Begum

      Friday 31 March 2023 21:23, UKDespite bans from all major social media sites, it's hard to move on the internet without bumping up against Andrew Tate - but who is the kickboxer-turned-influencer being held in Romania?Tate's rise to notoriety started when he was removed from Big Brother in 2016 over a video that appeared to show him attacking a woman with a belt - a clip he claims was edited.On 29 December 2022, he was  along with brother Tristan on suspicion of human trafficking, rape and forming an organised crime group, prosecutors said.The following day, a Romanian court .Their detention was then extended for another 30 days - until the end of February - and another 30 after that.Tate's appeal against a judge's decision to keep him locked up until at least 29 March was .He was subsequently released from jail on March 31 and It was the fourth time Tate had had a request to be released from custody denied since his arrest in December.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerOn 31 March the pair were released into house arrest after an appeals court rejected the proposal to extend their detention.According to the ruling, ""[The court] replaces the measure of preventive detention ordered against the defendants.. with the preventive measure of house arrest, for a period of 30 days.""But who is Tate, and how does a British-American kickboxer raised in Luton amass millions of followers, get  in the classroom, and spark a row with climate activist Greta Thunberg?Here’s everything you need to know.Tate was  last August for violating parent company Meta’s policies on ""dangerous individuals"". He had 4.7 million Instagram followers before his official account was deleted.He was  for breaching hate speech rules - but fan channels have filled in the gaps, posting videos that reach millions of views.TikTok has barred him from having an account but content posted under the hashtag Andrew Tate has been viewed billions of times.In November, analysis by the Centre for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) identified more than 100 TikTok accounts that frequently promote Tate's content, with a total of 250 million video views and 5.7 million followers.Twitter also banned him in 2017 for his misogynistic views and hate speech but reinstated his account last month following Elon Musk’s takeover.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerIn the week before his arrest, Tate sparked a row with climate campaigner Greta Thunberg on Twitter when he shared a picture of himself standing next to a Bugatti and saying he owned 33 cars.""Please provide your email address so I can send a complete list of my car collection and their respective enormous emissions,"" he tweeted, tagging Ms Thunberg.Ms Thunberg responded by saying: ""Yes, please do enlighten me"", adding a fake email address mocking him and ending with the words ""getalife.com"".Tate hit back with a video telling Ms Thunberg to ""get a life"". In the video he is smoking a cigar in a robe and is passed a stack of pizza boxes.After Tate's arrest, the internet was buzzing with the theory that the Romanian-branded pizza boxes led police to him.There's no evidence to back this up, but , tweeting: ""This is what happens when you don't recycle your pizza boxes.""The allegations levelled against Tate and his brother - along with two women arrested at the same time - centre around .Romania's DIICOT unit, which investigates terrorism and organised crimes, has said it has identified six victims who were subject to ""acts of physical violence and mental coercion"" and were ""sexually exploited by group members"".It is alleged that he and his brother lured women to Romania on the pretence of a romantic relationship and then forced them into carrying out pornographic acts under duress, which were then filmed.All four suspects deny the charges.Romanian authorities have  and 10 properties belonging to the suspects. Tate unsuccessfully appealed the asset seizure.Tate has suggested rape victims ""bear some responsibility"" for being attacked, said women ""belong in the home"" and referred to women as ""property"" of men.Describing how he would react if a woman accused him of cheating, he said: ""It's bang out the machete, boom in her face and grip her by the neck.""In a video explaining why he moved to Romania, he said ""probably 40% of the reason"" he moved was because it would be easier to evade rape charges.He added: ""I'm not a rapist, but I like the idea of just being able to do what I want. I like being free.""Tate has also said he would rather date 18-year-olds than 25-year-olds because he can ""make an imprint"" on teenagers who have had fewer sexual partners.In a 2017 tweet, he said: ""Depression isn't real. You feel sad, you move on. You will always be depressed if your life is depressing. Change it.""Tate has denied holding misogynistic views and accused his critics of ""twisting facts"", although he has also described himself as the ""king of toxic masculinity"".Tate founded online learning platform Hustler's University, charging $49.99 a month for courses on money-making schemes such as dropshipping and investing in cryptocurrency.The Guardian reported Tate's Hustler University members were told to flood social media with videos of him, which was described by experts as a ""blatant attempt to manipulate the algorithm"" and artificially boost his content.In less than three months, the strategy propelled him to viral fame and potentially made him millions of pounds, the report said. The ""affiliate scheme"", which enabled members to earn commission by signing up members and posting content, closed in August, according to The Guardian.

      Thursday 30 March 2023 20:17, UKThe grocery chain Planet Organic has put insolvency practitioners on standby as it races to find new backers in a bid to secure its future.Sky News has learnt that the company filed a notice of intention to appoint administrators on Thursday - a move which provides it with breathing space from creditors as it continues rescue talks.City sources said Planet Organic required a multimillion pound capital injection by the middle of April in order to survive.Discussions with a number of interested parties are said to be ongoing after Waitrose pulled out of talks late last week.Any sale of the business could take place through a pre-pack administration process, although sources said that Planet Organic's management, led by chief executive George Dymond, was focused on keeping the business as intact as possible.Any insolvency event would put a chunk of the chain's 360-strong workforce at risk.In a message to staff on Thursday seen by Sky News, Mr Dymond said: ""Over the past 12 months, we have been extremely busy fundraising in order to raise money to support the business and unlock our store expansion plan.""Despite our wonderful stores being largely profitable, a herculean effort by the buying team to improve our margins and a huge improvement in the costs of running both stores and the e-commerce business, it is a fact that the business is still loss-making.""In reality we have simply not got back to the levels of sales that we were seeing before the pandemic. So, while we have taken every possible action to improve our position, including additional investment from our existing shareholders, we have so far been unsuccessful in raising sufficient funds needed to support the business and the growth plan.""Since the beginning of the year, we have been in advanced discussions with a potential investor with a view to them supporting the business, putting a platform in place to enable us to achieve this growth.""Regrettably and unexpectedly these discussions ended last Friday without an investment being agreed. This is largely because of the current uncertainty in the retail sector, as well as market caution more broadly.""This unfortunately means that the future of Planet Organic is currently uncertain.""We are still working hard alongside our advisors to explore alternative options to secure investment which will enable us to preserve our amazing business and we remain in dialogue with a number of other interested parties.""In the meantime, however, we have had to take legal steps to protect the position of the business to afford us the time to be able to find a solution to the challenging situation we face, including filing at court a notice of intention to appoint administrators which is the first step in a potential administration process.""We know that this will create more media attention and a lot of questions from our customers - the key message is that it is business as usual for now.""I want you all to know how very sorry I am that we are in this position - I am conscious that this will be a very uncertain time for you all.""As a short-term measure, and in order to make sure that everyone is paid for work they have done, we will be running an interim payroll tomorrow.""For now that means it is business as usual and your support, as always, is greatly appreciated and essential to give Planet Organic the very best chance of securing a healthy future.""Planet Organic, which was founded in 1995 by Renee Elliot, has been working with Interpath Advisory on a review of its strategic options since early this year.The chain, which trades from 13 stores, sells organic food and drink, as well as healthcare and bodycare products.Like many retailers, its recent performance has been hampered by the pandemic and reduced city centre footfall.It is understood to have been loss-making in each of its last two financial years.

      Thursday 30 March 2023 15:15, UKLast week's surprise rise in the headline rate of inflation in the UK brought a reminder, if one were needed, of how hard it is, once the inflation genie is out of the bottle, to put it back in.Thursday brought a further reminder with news that consumer prices in Germany continued to rise this month at a faster pace than expected.The annual rate of consumer price  in the eurozone's biggest economy in March came in at 7.4% when measured by Germany's national standards. That was down from the rate of 8.7% in both January and February but ahead of the 7.2% figure the market had been expecting.An alternative measure, which is harmonised to EU standards, came in at 7.8%, again down from 8.7% in February, but again ahead of the 7.5% that the market had expected., food prices are exerting most upward pressure on inflation in Germany. They rose by 22.3% on a year-on-year basis - undoing much of the good done by a slowdown, to 3.5%, in the annual rate at which energy prices are rising.News of the figures sent the yield (which moves in the opposite direction to the price) of German government bonds higher.That move reflected the fact that the higher-than-expected figures will maintain pressure on the European Central Bank (ECB) to continue raising interest rates.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerThe ECB  two weeks ago from 2.5% to 3%.Yet the difficulty of the task faced by the ECB - which has to set an interest rates for a 20-country bloc that goes from Ireland and Portugal in the west to Cyprus in the east and from Finland in the north to Malta in the south - was underlined by figures published separately in Spain.Spain's annual rate of inflation fell from 6% in February to just 3.3% in March - significantly lower than the 3.8% that economists had expected.On the harmonised basis used by the EU, Spanish inflation fell from 6% in February to 3.1% in March, again significantly below the 4% that economists had expected.Food prices climbed by 16% year-on-year. The fact that Spanish food prices grew at a lower rate than in Germany is partly explained by Madrid's decision, just after Christmas, to cut the rate of VAT on essential foods such as bread, cheese, fruit, milk and vegetables from 4% to zero and to cut the VAT rate from 10% to 5% on pasta and cooking oils.What will probably jog the ECB to carry on raising interest rates, though, is the fact that, even with this big decline in Spain, so-called 'core' inflation - the measure than strips out volatile elements such as energy, food, drink, alcohol and tobacco - remains very sticky. In Spain, it fell very modestly, easing from 7.6% to 7.5%.This is probably the more important measure, in the eyes of the ECB, because it is an indication of how domestically-generated inflation is becoming entrenched rather than inflation in energy, food and drink, much of which can be explained by external factors, chiefly Russia's invasion of Ukraine.On that basis, further interest rate rises from the ECB in coming months remains the way to bet.

127,2023-04-02,Sky News,CPTPP: UK accepted into Indo-Pacific trade bloc in biggest trade deal since Brexit | Politics News | Sky News,"Prime Minister Rishi Sunak claims joining the 11-strong trade area will ""demonstrate the real economic benefits of our post-Brexit freedoms"".By  Alix Culbertson and Jennifer Scott, political reporters  Friday 31 March 2023 17:39, UKPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerThe UK has been accepted into an Indo-Pacific trade bloc in what the government says is its biggest trade deal since Brexit. The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) is a free trade agreement between 11 countries across the Indo-Pacific, including Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam - and now the UK.The partnership sees the countries open up their markets to one another, reducing trade barriers and tariffs, with the hope of bolstering the economies of its members.Trade Secretary  said the UK's accession to the CPTPP was formally confirmed in a telephone call between her and counterparts from the group at 1am BST on Friday.The UK is the first European country to enter the agreement, and the government claims it will lead to a £1.8bn boost to the economy ""in the long run"".Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the deal shows ""what we can achieve when we unleash the benefits of Brexit"".But his predecessor, Liz Truss, called on the government to use its membership to block China from joining.Releasing a statement, the former PM said: ""The CPTPP is a vital economic bulwark against China and in due course I would like to see other like-minded free-trading nations making their own applications to join.""It is essential, however, that any idea of Chinese accession is ruled out and I would expect the British government now or in the future to oppose any such proposal.""While the UK already has trade agreements with most of the CPTPP members, apart from Malaysia, UK officials said it would deepen existing arrangements, with 99% of UK goods exported to the bloc now eligible for zero tariffs.This includes cheese, cars, chocolate, machinery, gin and whisky, while Downing Street said the services industry would also enjoy ""reduced red tape and greater access to growing Pacific markets"".The deal has been praised by a number of business groups, including the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), Standard Chartered bank and the world's second-largest wine and spirits seller Pernod Ricard.But other trade experts have warned it will not make up for the economic hit caused by leaving the European Union.Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said joining the CPTPP is a ""massive opportunity"" for British exporters and shows ""our influence in this part of the world is becoming more significant"".Ms Badenoch told Sky News the difference between being part of the CPTPP and the EU is ""we make the rules and regulations on our standards"".She promised the deal is ""not going to displace farmers in the UK"" and said it will provide more competition for EU countries so ""people don't have to buy what they don't want"".Ms Badenoch admitted the lower tariffs will apply to palm oil, , but said you ""have to make trade-offs"" when doing a deal and said the UK currently buys 1% of Malaysia's exports and ""moving to 2% from 1% is not what is going to cause deforestation.""She claimed the UK will have ""more influence"" on sustainability as part of the bloc - despite Greenpeace calling the deal ""outrageous"".""Palm oil is actually a great product, it's in so many of the things we use,"" she added.""This is not some illegal substance we're talking about and actually there are other crops in the EU that are causing deforestation that fit within EU rules.""Political correspondentDepending on who you listen to, the UK's accession into CPTPP is either a triumph for post-Brexit global Britain or a miserly replacement to what we had with the EU.So which is it? The honest answer – as unsatisfying as it may be – is both and neither.The government's own impact assessment puts the economic boost of this trade deal at just 0.08%.Contrast that with the Office for Budget Responsibility's forecast of a 4% reduction in economic growth caused by Brexit, and it is clear CPTPP does not slot into the gap once filled by EU membership.But nor should it, because this deal is a completely different beast to what we had in Europe.While standards still matter, the emphasis on countries mirroring each other's rules that dominated EU talks is not there with CPTPP.
That is why ministers say the UK will still be able to maintain agricultural standards and block things like hormone-injected beef from Canada.
So if this isn't a case of ""the deal is done, let the good times roll"", what is the upside?For the government, CPTPP is more of a strategic and symbolic win. The trade secretary characterised it as ""getting in early"" with a start-up business that will go onto great things.Those ""great things"" are a boom in middle-class consumers in the region and potentially new and bigger countries joining the block in the future.Then there is the diplomatic context.This deal can be seen as part of a broader UK pivot to the Indo-Pacific region that was kicked off by the Integrated Review of foreign policy and built on by the AUKUS defence pact with Australia and the USA.Part of the reason for this is building a presence in regions where Beijing wields great influence.So given China wants to join CPTPP, it will now eventually fall to the UK and allies like Australia to decide whether to allow what would be a controversial accession to the bloc.As the chancellor put it today: ""That shows that our influence in this part of the world is becoming more significant.""The UK  in September 2021 when Boris Johnson was in Downing Street.The signatory countries of the CPTPP are home to 500 million people and the government claims the deal will be worth £11 trillion in GDP, accounting for 15% of global GDP.However, critics said the impact will be limited, with official estimates suggesting it will add just £1.8bn a year to the UK economy after 10 years, representing less than 1% of UK GDP.Mr Sunak said the agreement ""puts the UK at the centre of a dynamic and growing group of Pacific economies"".""We are at our heart an open and free-trading nation, and this deal demonstrates the real economic benefits of our post-Brexit freedoms,"" he added.""As part of CPTPP, the UK is now in a prime position in the global economy to seize opportunities for new jobs, growth and innovation.""Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerThe announcement was welcomed by business group the CBI which called it ""a real milestone for the UK and for British industry"".Interim general director Matthew Fell said: ""Not only does the agreement provide greater access to a group of fast growth economies representing 14% of global GDP and over 500 million consumers, but membership reinforces the UK's commitment to building partnerships in an increasingly fragmented world.""CPTPP countries and business need to work together to future-proof the rules-based trading system and stimulate growth with a focus on digital, services and resilient supply chains.""Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer welcomed the trade pact but warned the ""yield is very small"", saying the net contribution to the UK economy ""will be something in the order of 0.08%"".""I do think it's an important trade deal, but the yield is very small. Hopefully that will grow over time,"" he said.""But the rule in trade is that you're more likely to trade with your nearer neighbours more and more often, so we do need that improved, that better trading relationship with the EU alongside any other trade deals that we sign.""The Institute of Directors said it was ""vital the UK signs trade deals to restore our international reputation since Brexit"".But it added ""complete reorientation"" to the Indo-Pacific would not solve ""the very real problem that businesses currently face - namely that they have many more trade related challenges than they did six years ago"".""From our surveys, directors have told us that the EU-UK relationship is a priority issue the government needs to address in order to support business,"" they said.""UK companies still rely on the long-established links they have with EU markets, which are directly on our doorstep and with whom they have closer historical ties.""The Indo-Pacific strategy will open up important opportunities for UK businesses, but the government must not forfeit the significance of our relationship with the EU in order to do so.""

      Friday 31 March 2023 11:11, UKAn investment vehicle set up by one of the founders of Lovefilm is plotting a rescue bid for Planet Organic, the struggling grocer.Sky News has learnt that Redbus Ventures, which has assembled a large portfolio of stakes in early-stage consumer-facing businesses, is among a small number of parties exploring offers for the organic supermarket chain.City sources said Redbus Ventures - founded by Simon Franks, a prominent entrepreneur - was expected to table a proposal to inject several million pounds into Planet Organic imminently.Redbus Ventures describes itself as one of the most active funders of early-stage businesses in the UK, and counts online florist Flowerbx, Cleo, a fintech, and Perlego, a digital education platform, among the companies it has backed.Mr Franks built Lovefilm into a £200m business before selling it to Amazon in 2011, having previously sold Redbus Film Distribution to Lionsgate, the US media group.On Thursday, Sky News revealed that the chain had put insolvency practitioners on standby as it races to find new backers.It has filed a notice of intention to appoint administrators - a move which provides it with breathing space from creditors as it continues rescue talks.Discussions with a number of interested parties are ongoing after Waitrose pulled out of talks about a deal late last week.Insiders said that a sale of the business was increasingly likely to take place through a pre-pack administration process, which would be likely to put a chunk of the chain's 360-strong workforce at risk.Planet Organic chief executive George Dymond told staff this week that it had ""not got back to the levels of sales that we were seeing before the pandemic"".""So, while we have taken every possible action to improve our position, including additional investment from our existing shareholders, we have so far been unsuccessful in raising sufficient funds needed to support the business and the growth plan.""Since the beginning of the year, we have been in advanced discussions with a potential investor with a view to them supporting the business, putting a platform in place to enable us to achieve this growth.""Regrettably and unexpectedly these discussions ended last Friday without an investment being agreed. This is largely because of the current uncertainty in the retail sector, as well as market caution more broadly.""He added that the company was ""still working hard alongside our advisors to explore alternative options to secure investment"", but said it had had to take steps to commence preparations for insolvency.""We know that this will create more media attention and a lot of questions from our customers - the key message is that it is business as usual for now,"" he said.""I want you all to know how very sorry I am that we are in this position - I am conscious that this will be a very uncertain time for you all.""Be the first to get Install the Sky News app for freePlanet Organic, which was founded in 1995 by Renee Elliot, has been working with Interpath Advisory on a review of its strategic options since early this year.The chain, which trades from 13 stores, sells organic food and drink, as well as healthcare and bodycare products.Like many retailers, its recent performance has been hampered by the pandemic and reduced city centre footfall.It is understood to have been loss-making in each of its last two financial years.

As things stand, it will take more than 50 years to reach gender pay parity.
          Business correspondent
              
      Friday 31 March 2023 10:36, UKThe gender pay gap has narrowed - but women are still paid 89p for every £1 a man earns on average, Sky News analysis suggests.Employers with more than 250 staff have been . The latest figures show the gap has come down from 11% in 2018 to 10.1%.Last year, the figure stood at 10.4%. But comparisons with the previous two years are flawed because the furlough scheme, which was introduced during the , distorted the results.The figure is based on an analysis of the 4,791 organisations that have reported their results so far ahead of the deadline next Wednesday. Last year, 10,505 were submitted.The  measures the difference in pay between men and women across the workforce, irrespective of the jobs they do, and is not a measure of unequal pay.Campaigners have welcomed the progress but said structural barriers, including a lack of affordable childcare, would continue to impede women's pay prospects.A recent report by PwC found the loss in earnings experienced by women raising children had become the most significant driver of the gender pay gap.It said an 18-year-old woman entering the workforce today would not see pay equality in her working lifetime.At the rate the gender pay gap is closing, it said, it will take more than 50 years to reach gender pay parity.Sectors that traditionally have very segregated roles can post large pay gaps.In the airline industry, for example, high-paid pilots tend to be men, while lower-paid cabin crew are more likely to be women. The industry recorded a 33.5% pay gap in 2018.None of the major airlines have reported yet but, among those that have, the pay gap appears to be narrowing to 28.5%.However analysts warn the headline figures do not paint the full picture.In traditionally male-dominated sectors that are trying to attract more women, such as construction, pay gaps can also widen as businesses make efforts to recruit more women.Graduates, trainees or apprentices typically start on lower salaries, which can lead to even bigger pay gaps.Wates Group, one of Britain's largest family-owned construction companies, has been trying to close a pay gap that last year stood at 30.5%.It has increased paternity and maternity leave, and introduced carer's leave, as well as an internship programme to recruit young women.Nikunj Upadhyay, the company's inclusion and diversity director, said representation of women in senior leadership roles has gone from 21% to 24% in the past year.The latest figures suggest that women in the construction sector are paid 23.9% less than men. Although about 100 companies are yet to report, this is an improvement on the 24.9% pay gap recorded in 2018.This is largely because of strides to increase the number of women in higher-paid senior jobs, with their representation rising from 7.8% to 9.6%.However the share of women in the sector's lower-paid roles also increased from 33.1% to 34.1%, as more entered the industry.Be the first to get Install the Sky News app for freeStatisticians said a sharper focus on pay quartiles rather than the pay gap percentage may give a better indication of a company's performance.Nigel Marriott, a fellow at the Royal Statistical Society, said: ""Employers who obsess over a 1.65% change in their median gender pap statistic are missing the point entirely. The story is where are your men and women on your pay scale.""

          Business correspondent
              
      Tuesday 28 March 2023 15:27, UKPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerHow worried should we be about the banks?It's a question that's been hanging over the financial system since the collapse in the space of a fortnight of three moderate American banks, including  (SVB), followed by Swiss behemoth .The spectacle of regulators, political leaders and bankers spending sleepless weekends managing insolvencies, bailouts and takeovers, against the red-ink backdrop of lurching markets, has stirred memories of 2008 and the financial crash.The answer from Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey, repeated to MPs on the Treasury Select Committee on Tuesday, is ""don't panic"", not yet anyway.Mr Bailey conceded that recent events made this a moment of ""heightened tension and alertness"", but that comparisons with 2008 are erroneous and, so far, UK regulations introduced post-crash are passing the test.His diagnosis is that while the issues that brought down SVB and Credit Suisse are distinct and separate, the interconnectedness of the financial system means the risk of contagion cannot be ignored.SVB collapsed because of poor risk management, with deposits locked into fixed incomes investments that fell in value as interest rates rose. Credit Suisse meanwhile, after a decade of unerringly finding new scandals in which to become embroiled, finally stepped on a rake it could not recover from.Mr Bailey found himself directly involved with the fallout from SVB, engineering the  over a long weekend, with the deal only confirmed he said at 4am on the Monday, hours before markets reopened.The actions taken by the Bank he said proved the value of new regulation.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerSVB had a distinct UK presence because its British branch had grown to a point it was required to become a separate subsidiary. That in turn gave the Bank of England and the Prudential Regulation Authority options in managing its decline, one of which was a sale.Mr Bailey and his colleagues did concede there are lessons to learn, primarily from the speed with which confidence and, crucially, deposits were withdrawn from the banks.As a result they will re-examine whether the current bank ""stress tests"" governing liquidity - the amount of cash banks must have on hand to absorb shocks to the system - are adequate.Technology may have helped change that calculation. In 2007 we knew Northern Rock was on the brink because customers were queuing outside branches. Today you can withdraw funds digitally in the time it takes to read this sentence, and a bank run could be underway by the end of the paragraph.Deputy governor Dave Ramsden told MPs that messaging apps further accelerate the potential for bank runs, and said this was a factor in the SVB collapse, with the bulk of depositors all working in the tight-knit US tech industry.""They were a tech-savvy group, already using messaging in ordinary situations, using it in a run situation.""The result was what Bailey called ""the fastest journey from health to death since Barings"", a reference to the British investment bank that collapsed spectacularly in 1995.But he insisted the issues are bank-specific and isolated, describing the jitters that have seen banks stocks rise and fall rapidly as markets ""testing"" various institutions, looking for weakness. The latest example came on Friday afternoon, when Deutsche Bank's valuation fell without an obvious trigger only to recover on Monday.""My very strong view of the UK banking system is that it is in a very strong position,"" Bailey said. ""But there are moves in markets to test out firms, they are not based on identified weakness, rather they're testing out. There's a lot of testing going on.""

By  Sharon Marris, news reporter  Saturday 1 April 2023 05:19, UKHouseholds and businesses are facing increased costs on a number of items and services today.Broadband, mobile and water bills are among those being hiked, along with corporation and council tax and energy charges for businesses.Here, Sky News explains what is affected - and what you can do if you're struggling.The national minimum wage and the national living wage are both increasing. What's the difference? The national minimum wage is a legal requirement - employers must pay you at least this much. The national living wage is higher and workers get it if they're over 23.The living wage is going up by 92p an hour to £10.42 an hour for workers aged 23 and over and the Resolution Foundation says this will be the biggest annual cash hike in the wage's 24-year history.Around 1.7 million workers earning up to 5p above the previous minimum wage will be most likely to notice the difference in their pay packets. Another five million low-paid workers will also benefit, as employers look to maintain differentials between pay bands.The new rates are:The Trades Union Congress, however, says the increase in the minimum wage is not enough to keep up with inflation, which has been at around 10% in recent months.But a rise in the minimum wage is not good news for everyone - businesses have to find more money to pay their workers and, as we'll see later, they already have some pretty big price rises of their own to worry about.Corporation tax is going up six percentage points today to 25% for business with profits exceeding £250,000.Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has insisted that this will only affect 10% of businesses.Tina McKenzie, policy chair at the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), said: ""This week sees the end of meaningful energy support for most small firms, alongside rising employment costs and increases to corporation tax.""The combined pressures facing firms right now will greatly impact small businesses' ability to weather the storm, and leaves them facing very tough choices.""It's crucial we keep a strong small business economy so there are jobs, competition and a strong offer for consumers.""Alex Veitch, director of policy at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said: ""Changes on corporation tax, water bills and the minimum wage are all extra costs that businesses have known were coming. But when piled on top of energy bills they make it a difficult start to the new financial year.""Firms knew before the budget that corporation tax would rise, and the super-deduction tax incentive was going, but its replacement does not appear as generous.""The most recent BCC survey on investment found that only a fifth of firms were increasing investment and a similar number were reducing it.""The government is unlikely to see the economic growth it desperately needs when so many businesses are still fighting to keep their heads above water.""Businesses will see massive hikes in their energy bills because the government's energy bill relief scheme comes to an end today.The BCC has said that almost half of firms will be finding it difficult to afford to pay their bills from now on.Mr Veitch said the organisation had suggested seven ways the government could help businesses get through this difficult time but ""not one was acted upon"".These included things such as easing the burden of VAT on energy bills and funding for improved business energy efficiency.Households are also facing the prospect of paying more for their energy supply.Most will have received £400 from the government in the form of discounts on energy bills from late last year - so about £67 a month. Well, your last instalment of that was in March - it's over now.There is some ongoing support for the most vulnerable, but the support will no longer be given to everyone regardless of circumstance.The government's energy price guarantee, brought in late last year as a sort of de-facto price cap, .But because most of us have lost the £400 government support, we will effectively be paying more.Standing charges - the daily rate you pay to have an energy supply (regardless of how much you use) - are also going up from today.The average household water bill is going up by £31 a year to £448 - a rise of 7.5% - for customers in England and Wales.Mobile and broadband prices are expected to rise by between 14% and 17%. Citizens Advice said these could add an average of £90 a year to household bills. This is especially frustrating, as many telecoms suppliers regularly hike bills anyway - even if you're in the middle of a contract.Matthew Upton, director of policy at Citizens Advice, said: ""We called on these firms to support their customers during this uniquely challenging time, but they didn't listen. Instead, they're pushing ahead with these mid-contract price rises.""Ofcom should be holding these companies to account, but it has kicked the can down the road with a review that won't land until the end of the year.""When the regulator does act, it must deal with this once and for all by banning any future mid-contract price hikes.""Most local authorities are hiking council tax by 5% from April.This means that a band D home can expect to pay about an extra £100 a year, with the average bill topping £2,000 for the first time, according to government figures released last week.The rate of personal tax hasn't actually increased, but you're still likely to end up paying more. Let me explain.The government  that personal tax thresholds - the point at which a worker starts paying tax or starts paying tax at a higher rate - will be frozen in England, Wales and Northern Ireland until 2028.Incomes generally rise - especially when workers are having to cope with high inflation and other living costs. But if the tax thresholds stay the same, more workers get dragged into the next tax band. This is what economists call fiscal drag and it's what newspapers often call a stealth tax.The Institute of Fiscal Studies says that the freezing of income tax and national insurance allowances and thresholds will cost most basic rate taxpayers an extra £500 and most higher rate taxpayers £1,000.The Resolution Foundation says the size of the UK's 'stealth tax' threshold freeze over six years has almost trebled to £25bn, compared to the £9bn forecast when it was originally announced in the 2021 budget, and later extended.You mean that's not enough?Prescription charges are going up in England by 30p from today, taking the fee per item to £9.65.We already know that the price of food is continuing to rise, and .  - fine if you're sitting on a fixed rate, but potentially very painful if you're about to re-mortgage.And renters aren't safe either - if a landlord is having to pay more to own the house, you can bet they're likely to recoup at least some of that from the occupants.The average prices of unleaded, super unleaded and diesel are expected to fall, however. That's right - fall! You might remember those crazy days of July when a litre of unleaded was averaging 191.43p - well, by 15 March, it was sitting at 147.28p.And according to RAC Fuel Watch, the prices will fall further.

Instead, they will need to reduce or be open to offers in order to get a more realistic and efficient sale.""Myron Jobson, senior personal finance analyst at interactive investor, said: ""While the consensus is that house prices will fall this year, it is a more nuanced picture.""Property values may indeed fall in very stretched areas, and for other areas, prices may not change very much - if at all.Be the first to get Install the Sky News app for free""The housing market remains a frustrating one for would be buyers, fraught with uncertainty and unpredictability.""The affordability crunch could mean that existing homeowners may wait to list their properties, since many have already locked in lower mortgage rates, creating little incentive to sell and buy again until rates are more attractive.""

      Saturday 1 April 2023 02:42, UKHundreds of thousands of small businesses could face ""tough decisions"" following changes to the energy support scheme, according to the Federation of Small Businesses.The Energy Bills Discount scheme has been introduced to provide UK businesses, charities and the public sector support with energy bills.This scheme for non-domestic energy users will see discounts provided on high energy bills until 31 March 2024.Until now, the Energy Bill Relief scheme capped energy costs, but the new support measure will only see bills discounted.The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) estimates around 370,000 small businesses will be negatively impacted by it.Craig Beaumont, Chief of External Affairs at the FSB, told Sky News that these small businesses will face ""tough decisions"" in the months ahead.He said: ""We'll see some small businesses reduce their hours of operation, we'll have some having to let staff go, or look at other major expenditures.

      Saturday 1 April 2023 13:08, UKSir Richard Branson's cruise-line venture is seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in fresh funding even as the Virgin Group founder faces financial turbulence in other parts of his business empire.Sky News has learnt that Virgin Voyages is in the early stages of plans to raise a substantial sum of money from new and existing investors.Sources close to the situation said this weekend that it was too early to determine the scale of the prospective fundraising, or the mix of debt and equity it would involve.The disclosure of Virgin Voyages' talks to secure new capital comes just days after Virgin Orbit, Sir Richard's commercial satellites business, said it would lay off the majority of its staff and cease operations after running out of money.He injected $11m into the business this week to fund the redundancies of nearly 700 staff.Its looming collapse is a blow to the tycoon as well as public market investors who backed Virgin Orbit's 2021 merger with a special purpose acquisition company listed in New York at a valuation of over $3bn.Virgin Voyages also launched in 2021 - following a 15-month delay caused by COVID-19 - with its maiden journey from Portsmouth in August of that year.

While that likely burnished his company's reputation in the heady afterglow of his 2016 victory, Trump's role in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and his deepening legal woes since leaving office risk tainting the Trump Organization's once-gilded brand.Although it is Trump who faces charges, his company also played a role in the affair that triggered the investigation by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. In 2017, Trump Organization executives reimbursed former  for a payment he made to adult star Stormy Daniels, allegedly in return for her silence about a sexual relationship with the former president before the 2016 election.""They're doomed, I think. Who would want to do business with this organization or with Trump?"" said Bennett Gershman, a law professor at Pace University and a former prosecutor in the New York State Anti-Corruption Office.Trump Organization companies rely on financing to build resorts, hotels, golf clubs and residences. In Gershman's view, the Trump Organization's  last year made the company ""toxic"" for many potential lenders and business partners. While the indictment of its former CEO may not directly add to those legal woes, it may further tarnish the company's reputation.""The corporation is already toxic. Now, when the chief of that corporation, the head of that corporation, is under indictment, that doesn't help the image of the corporation,"" Gershman said. ""It seems to me they've already taken this big hit, there's already trouble, and now Trump is making it worse.""A spokesperson for the Trump Organization did not respond to a request for comment. Republicans in Congress have mounted a full-throated defense of the former president, deriding the indictment as a politically motivated hit job.""These are political figures, fighting the leading political candidate,"" Trump attorney Alina Habba told WABC News Radio Thursday.  ""They're all people trying to find a reason to remove Donald Trump as the future president of this country again.""Of course, the subject of an indictment, like anyone charged with a crime, is presumed innocent. However, ""The fact that we know, legally, it's merely an accusation, not proof — that doesn't matter here,"" Gershman said. ""An indictment is the perception of wrongdoing, and the perception of wrongdoing by the head of a corporation makes people worried.""According to Randy Zelin, a criminal defense lawyer and professor at Cornell Law School, said the biggest legal threat to the Trump Organization is the  filed in September by New York's attorney general, who is seeking to ban the company from dong business in the state.That lawsuit ""would really be a final nail in the coffin,"" Zelin said. ""People will begin, if they haven't already, to distance themselves."" New York's case, which is scheduled to go to trial in October, accuses the Trump Organization, as well as Trump, Donald Trump, Jr., Eric Trump and Ivanka Trump, of a years-long effort to commit fraud by .  New York Attorney General Letitia James has said the alleged fraud added ""billions"" to Trump's property values. The company and the Trumps have denied the allegations.It's hard to tell what financial impact, if any, its legal issues may have had on the Trump Organization.

Fiona swept through the Caribbean and then north up to Canada while Ian hit parts of Cuba before devastating sections of Florida.The WMO uses a rotating list of names for tropical cyclones that get repeated every six years, the organization said. In the future, Ian's former spot will be replaced with Idris and Fiona will be replaced with Farrah, WMO announced.Most of Puerto Rico was left without power after  hit as a Category 1 in September 2022, killing at least three people there. The storm then continued to gain strength as it lashed the Dominican Republic and Turks and Caicos before strengthening to a Category 4 storm and heading for Bermuda. The storm's path then took it to Canada, where it became the costliest extreme weather event ever in Atlantic Canada, according to WMO. All told the storm was responsible for 29 deaths, WMO said.A few weeks later, in October,  struck both Cuba and Florida as a Category 4 hurricane. More than 100 people were killed in Florida, making the storm the third-deadliest to hit the U.S. mainland and, according to the WMO, the costliest in Florida's history.According to the U.S. National Hurricane Center and WMO, powerful hurricanes are expected to continue becoming more frequent as a result of climate change. ""The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's  projects that the global proportion of tropical cyclones that reach very intense (category 4-5) levels, along with their peak winds and rainfall rates, are expected to increase with climate warming,"" WMO said Wednesday.Experts at the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration  that warmer ocean water fuels .

152,2023-04-02,CBS News,T. rex's ferocious image may have just taken a hit,"AP The Tyrannosaurus rex is often shown baring massive, sharp teeth, like the ferocious creature in ""Jurassic Park."" But new research suggests that this classic image might be wrong.The teeth on T. rex and other big theropods were likely covered by scaly lips, concludes . The dinosaur's teeth didn't stick out when its mouth was closed, and even in a wide open bite, you might just see the tips, the scientists found.The research is the latest in a long back-and-forth over how dinosaur mouths really looked. Recent depictions show big teeth jutting out of the dinosaurs' jaws, even when closed. Some thought the predators' teeth were just too big to fit in their mouths, said study author Thomas Cullen, a paleontologist at Auburn University in Alabama.When researchers compared skulls from dinosaurs and living reptiles, though, they found this wasn't the case. Some large monitor lizards actually have bigger teeth than T. rex compared to their skull size and can still fit them under a set of scaly lips, Cullen said.The scientists also found clues in the pattern of wear and tear on tooth surfaces.For a creature like a crocodile, whose teeth stick out of its mouth, the exposed part gets worn down quickly — ""like someone's taken a sander to the side of the tooth,"" said another study author Mark Witton, a paleoartist at England's University of Portsmouth.But when researchers analyzed a tooth from a Daspletosaurus, a T. rex relative, they found it was in good condition and didn't show that uneven damage pattern.With this evidence and other clues from the dinosaurs' anatomy, the study makes a good case for lipped tyrannosaurs, said University of Maryland paleontologist Thomas Holtz, who wasn't involved with the study. Still, ""We're not talking kissy lips,"" he pointed out — they'd be thin and scaly like those of the Komodo dragon, a large lizard.It's not the first time our depictions of dinosaurs have been called into question: Other research has shown that T. rex was more hunched over than we used to think and that fierce velociraptors probably sported feathers. Most of what we know about dinosaurs comes from their bones but it can be harder to get clear answers about soft tissues like skin, which usually aren't preserved as fossils.Adding lips may make dinosaurs look a little less ferocious, but it also makes them feel more realistic, Witton said.""You don't really see a monster,"" he said.

But it turns out that plants may have been telling you all along. A new study found that when plants are stressed, they emit specific sounds that identify what's wrong. Previous studies had shown that plants vibrate when under stress, but for years, scientists have debated whether those vibrations become sound waves. By studying tomato and tobacco plants in an acoustic chamber inside a greenhouse, researchers at Tel Aviv University discovered that it's true – plants cry out for help through airborne ultrasonic sounds.A groundbreaking TAU study found that  emit sounds, especially when in distress, at frequencies too high for us to hear.  was used to distinguish different plants' .    ""We found that plants usually emit sounds when they are under stress and that each plant and each type of stress is associated with a specific identifiable sound,"" researchers said in a  from the university. ""While imperceptible to the human ear, the sounds emitted by plants can probably be heard by various animals, such as bats, mice, and insects."" Human adults can only hear frequencies up to 16 kilohertz, researchers said, but ultrasonic microphones placed about 10 centimeters from each plant used in the study detected sounds at frequencies between 20 and 250 kilohertz. Those recordings were analyzed by special AI algorithms that could differentiate between plants and the types of sounds they were emitting. And the more stressed plants were, the more they screamed. ""Unstressed plants emitted less than one sound per hour, on average,"" researcher Lilach Hadany said, ""while the stressed plants – both dehydrated and injured – emitted dozens of sounds every hour."" They also found that after a certain peak of dehydration, the sounds would simply stop. Their findings were published in the journal  on Thursday. ""Our findings suggest that the world around us is full of plant sounds, and that these sounds contain information – for example about water scarcity or injury,"" Hadany said. ""We assume that in nature the sounds emitted by plants are detected by creatures nearby, such as bats, rodents, various insects, and possibly also other plants - that can hear the high frequencies and derive relevant information."" But it's not just small animals and insects that can use this information, but humans too, Hadany said. All they need is the ""right tools – such as sensors that tell growers when plants need watering."" This could prove particularly beneficial in the agriculture industry, as researchers noted in their publication that ""more precise irrigation can save up to 50% of the water expenditure and increase the yield."" This ability could only get more important as climate change continues to increase the intensity and frequency of droughts and the world continues to grapple with food security issues. ""Apparently, an idyllic field of flowers can be a rather noisy place,"" Hadany said.

Ron DeSantis is ""suited to be a leader of our country"" and called him ""fundamentally uncourageous,"" noting the length of time that passed before DeSantis  Trump's . ""Anyone that's coming in as sort of a professional politician, with all the plastic features, I don't see our base ending there. I think they need the outsider,"" Ramaswamy told CBS News during a visit to Washington D.C. earlier this week.Ramaswamy, a 37-year-old Indian American CEO who has been a frequent guest on Fox News, has been visiting early presidential primary states and says he will launch a daily podcast about his campaign soon.But he is still a relatively unknown figure to the GOP base. In early presidential primary polls, Ramaswamy's name either has not registered or a plurality of voters have said they don't know who he is. In a , 49% of Republicans said they hadn't heard about him. But Ramaswamy, whose presidential run is his first run for office, argues he can be the ""outsider"" politician that the Republican base — and Trump's base of voters — want.  ""It's not going to be immediate. It's going to be a 14- to 16-month project,"" Ramaswamy said of his campaign.He claims he would take Trump's ""America First"" agenda ""further than he ever did"" — and in a less divisive way. Ramaswamy vowed to ""take on"" affirmative action, the ""climate cult,"" show a ""use of force to solve the [Mexican drug] cartel problem"" and says he would shut down the Department of Education, which he maintains has ""no reason to exist,"" a stance popular among a number of Republicans, including Trump. Ramaswamy feels the country is in ""the middle of a national identity crisis"" and that younger generations think of themselves as ""victims rather than victors,"" a core stance in one of his books.""Conservatives are hungry, they want to go further, but they don't want to abandon the moral core of conservatism,"" Ramaswamy said, without answering whether Trump has damaged that ""moral core,"" as Trump faces an arraignment next week in Manhattan, while several other investigations of the former president are underway.Ramaswamy believes that the presidential primary race will change after the first debate in August, especially for DeSantis, whose potential candidacy has attracted wide interest among Republicans already. ""He happens to be the one that I think the country believes might actually be a career politician who has a shot, [but] I think that we the country and the Republican base certainly will see through that act. I think they're already starting to,"" Ramaswamy said. DeSantis has not officially launched a 2024 run yet, but has been making visits to early presidential primary states and battleground states to promote his new book and talk to local Republican groups. And in early hypothetical surveys of the 2024 field so far this year, DeSantis is always in the top two with Trump, with many other candidates trailing far behind. Still, Ramaswamy is eager to take on DeSantis directly, and characterized him as a kid who grew up ""in their sheltered environment"" and said DeSantis has created an ""echo chamber"" of support in Florida. DeSantis ""indulged himself into thinking that's actually the world. The world's not going to be nice to you, man,"" said Ramaswamy.""We're talking about representing the freaking United States of America on the global stage. That can't be the guy. He doesn't have it. I know he's deeply insecure. He won't tell you whether he got the second shot.

Ramaswamy said he was not sure how this indictment or any future charges stemming from other investigations of Trump will affect the nomination race. As for the rest of the potential 2024 field, Ramaswamy was quick to label them ""professional career politicians"" who would not win the support of Republican primary voters.Of former South Carolina Governor and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, the only other declared candidate in the race besides Ramaswamy and Trump, the biotech entrepreneur said she was a ""classic case"" of a ""professional career politician.""

158,2023-04-02,CBS News,Why Wisconsin's Supreme Court race is the most expensive election of its kind ever,"CBS News Wisconsin voters head to the polls Tuesday to elect their next state Supreme Court justice in what could be the most consequential race of 2023. The race has already garnered national attention, with potential implications for an array of issues, including abortion and voting rights, as well as the 2024 presidential election. And the high-stakes race is the most expensive state Supreme Court race ever.While the Wisconsin Supreme Court is technically nonpartisan, the results of the election will determine whether the court, which could weigh in on politically charged issues in the battleground state, will have a conservative- or liberal-leaning 4-3 majority.""We're living in a national environment in which state supreme courts are being given the opportunity by the U.S. Supreme Court to rule on these extraordinarily important and consequential issues,"" said Howard Schweber, political science and law professor at the University of Wisconsin.Conservative candidate and former Justice Daniel Kelly is running against liberal Judge Janet Protasiewicz to fill the seat being vacated by conservative Patience Roggensack, who is not seeking reelection. Her retirement opens an opportunity for the balance of the state's highest court to shift after conservatives held the majority for 15 years. The election will decide the makeup of the court for at least the next two years. Wisconsin state Supreme Court justices are elected for 10-year terms.""To call these elections nonpartisan is simply absurd,"" said Schweber. ""They are very much partisan driven, they are very much party driven, and it's very much that these two sides will try to promote candidates that they think will promote their agendas.""More than $27 million has been spent on ads in the general election alone since the Feb. 21 primary. Protasiewicz and groups supporting her have spent over $15 million, while Kelly and groups supporting him have poured over $12 million into the race. Protasiewicz and her supporters were outspending Kelly and his backers on ads for weeks, but that trend reversed in the last week of March.In total, spending on the Wisconsin Supreme Court race is close to $45 million, according to a review by WisPolitics.com, which drew from financial records that included the primary election. The sum shattered the previous record for a single supreme court race, $15.2 million in Illinois in 2004, according to data from the Brennan Center for Justice. Ben Wikler, chair of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, noted this election could ""shape the rules that will affect the 2024 presidential race, the fight for the House majority, and the fight for the Senate majority."" The state Democratic party is both running a major ""get out the vote"" operation across the state as well as raising millions for Protasiewicz. The Wisconsin GOP has also been holding events across the state and actively promoting his candidacy.  ""What I tell people is all the reforms we've had in the last 25 years going back to [Republican] Gov. Tommy Thompson I think are under threat if the liberals take over the court,"" said Wisconsin Republican Party Chairman Brian Schimming. Protasiewicz currently serves as a Milwaukee County Circuit Court judge. Before she was first elected in 2014, she served as a Milwaukee assistant district attorney for more than 25 years.Kelly previously served on the Wisconsin Supreme Court from 2016 to 2020 having been appointed by former Republican Gov. Scott Walker. He lost the 2020 Supreme Court election to now-Justice Jill Korofsky. Since then he has returned to private practice, a stint that included serving as legal counsel to the Wisconsin Republican party.Both candidates have been going head-to-head over abortion rights, an issue  could end up before the court in Wisconsin. Protasiewicz has been running ads against Kelly, claiming he would uphold the state's pro-Roe 1849 abortion ban which went into effect after the . It does not include exemptions for rape or incest. Kelly, who is endorsed by multiple anti-abortion groups including Wisconsin Right to Life, has pushed back saying he will decide the issue based on the law. He's criticized Protasiewicz for openly saying she believes women should have access to abortion. Kelly accused Protasiewicz of having already made up her mind on how she would rule if a case came before the court.Redistricting has also emerged as a top issue in the race. Last year, the Wisconsin Supreme Court approved the Republican-drawn maps similar to the 2011 plan, when Republicans held a state-government trifecta during the redistricting process. The maps essentially lock in Republican control of the Assembly and Senate, but that could immediately change with a shift in the makeup of the state Supreme Court. Protasiewicz has called the maps unfair and rigged. And the court is likely to have a say in voting rights cases ahead of the 2024 election where the state is a critical battleground in the presidential race. Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat, is also up for reelection. Republicans, who control both chambers of the state legislature, have moved to pass a series of different voter laws over the years ranging from voter ID requirements to absentee voting restrictions. The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled last year that absentee ballot drop boxes are illegal in the state. ""There are just numerous opportunities for the courts to either uphold rules designed to suppress voter turnout or to create them on their own accord,"" Schweber said. Democrats have hit Kelly hard on voting laws. The conservative former justice is an ally of former President Trump, who previously backed him in his failed 2020 bid. He served as ""special counsel"" for the state Republican party regarding a plan for fake Republican electors in the 2020 election, according to testimony by the former party chair before the Jan. 6 House select committee. Kelly has downplayed his role, but he has been backed by a conservative activist, Scott Presler, who has organized ""stop the steal"" events, and was on Capitol grounds on January 6, 2021. Presler has been traveling the state campaigning for Kelly who posted a video of them together earlier this month. At the same time, Republicans and outside groups have attacked Protasiewicz as soft on crime and say she has allowed criminals to walk, running a series of ads highlighting cases over which she's presided. She says  the examples were  cherry-picked out of thousands of cases and lack context. It's an issue that often is used to mobilize voters – an important factor for either candidate to win. Both party and political experts said it's hard to determine what turnout in the election could look like. But turnout in off-year elections, even in those when it is higher than usual, is still considerably lower than in general elections. The previous record for a spring election in the state was about 34%, whereas the turnout for the 2020 general election was over 72%. But operatives on both sides believe issues like redistricting, abortion, school choice and crime could help turn out voters in an off year. In-person early absentee voting has already been underway since March 21. Polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 8p.m. on Election Day, Tuesday. CBS News reporter covering economic policy.","Abortion, Wisconsin Supreme Court",politics news

Its owner, Israeli chef Alon Shaya, has been winning awards for his modern Middle Eastern cuisine, which is odd given that, when he first emigrated from Israel at the age of four, his roots were something he'd hoped to erase. ""I spent so much of my life trying to hide my Israeli identity,"" Shaya said, recalling, ""At the age of four and five years old, the last thing you want to do is talk to them about this chickpea fritter that you're bringing to school, when they're eating tater tots.""In culinary school, instead of hummus and pita, Shaya went full Italian; his passions were pastas, charcuterie and pizzas. Until, that is, in his mid-30's when, on a trip back to Israel, the dishes of his youth whispered anew. ""I realized that I was really missing out on a part of who I was,""  he said. He started cooking Israeli food again. And that, he said, was when he ""really began understanding what my identity was as a chef.""Ever since, he's been marinating in Israeli ingredients, and their history, which one day brought him to perhaps an unlikely place for a chef: the archives of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. He was both heartened and disturbed to learn that during the Holocaust, those forced into Jewish ghettos and concentration camps would write down family recipes, not to cook, but to remember. ""I was just blown away by how, during one of the most horrible moments in someone's life, that they could turn to food, and that food would have that power,"" he said. Steven Fenves was 13 when his train arrived at Auschwitz in 1944. Memories of food, he said, would remind inmates of home: ""It reminded you of pleasure in this lousy place where you were not a human,"" he said. All the tangible evidence of Fenves' life before had been ripped away, or so he thought. To his surprise, after he and his sister were liberated from Auschwitz, his mother's recipe book appeared. Steven Fenves' family had lived an upper-middle-class life in the former Yugoslavia. They employed a maid, a chauffeur, a governess, and a cook named Maris. ""Big woman! Very thick Hungarian accent,"" said Steven. On the day looters stormed into his home as his family were being sent off – presumably to the gas chambers – Maris, who wasn't Jewish, raced in to save the family cookbook for reasons Steven still doesn't totally understand. ""I think it was a sense of loyalty, and a sense of love for the family,"" he said. It was, he admitted, a pretty brave thing for Maris to do, when the risk to her was punishment by death. When Shaya discovered the book in the basement of the Holocaust Museum's collection, he had one question: Could he actually talk to someone who remembers eating this food? ""And they said, 'Yeah, maybe we can put you guys in touch,'"" he said. When Shaya heard Steven's story, he was so moved that he set about re-creating the taste of his childhood. The recipes had to be adapted: ""The recipes in this book aren't written like recipes like you would see in a cookbook today,"" he said. Cowan asked, ""So, it's not like, a half a teaspoon of this?""""No, no. Imagine your grandmother teaching you how to make a dish, you know, a little bit of this, a little bit of that,"" Shaya replied. Fenves said, ""Essentially, you know, there were no heat setting instructions, because this was all done on a cast iron stove.""""I don't have that setting on my stove!"" Shaya laughed. There were potato circles, a walnut cream cake, and semolina sticks.Fenves began translating the recipes from Hungarian into English, and Shaya began cooking the food and shipping the food to Fenves to taste for the first time in more than 70 years.Steven's whole family got involved, and in the process Fenves rediscovered a painful personal connection to his story that he says had gotten lost over the years. ""It had become such a chore,"" he said, when bearing witness to the horrors of the Holocaust. ""I no longer broke into tears in my presentation. It just became so routine, so cold.""But somehow Shaya's revival of his mother's cooking reminded him of all that was lost. ""Frankly speaking, he got me out of a major slump in my duty to speak as a volunteer survivor,"" Fenves said. ""How did he get you out of your slump?"" asked Cowan. ""He made it new; he made it interesting, and made it moving. … The effect of it on me was very pronounced. I mean, childhood food? It seemed to have been something tangential that went by the way with lots of other things that went by the way.""Together, these newfound friends now host donor dinners where his mother's dishes are served, and Fenves speaks. So far, they've raised more than $300,000 for Holocaust conservation efforts. Passover is about the imperative to remember, both the good and the bad. Alon Shaya offered that gift through food, and because of it, Steven Fenves has a renewed mission to tell the terrible tale that must be told.",Holocaust,science news

161,2023-04-02,CBS News,Andrew Tate moved to house arrest in Romania after months in police custody,"AP Andrew Tate, the divisive internet personality who has  in a Romanian jail on suspicion of organized crime and human trafficking, has won an appeal to replace his detention with house arrest, an official said Friday.The Bucharest Court of Appeal ruled in favor of Tate's appeal, which challenged a judge's decision last week to  a fourth time for 30 days, said Ramona Bolla, a spokesperson for Romania's anti-organized crime agency, DIICOT.The 36-year-old Tate, a British-U.S. citizen who has 5.5 million Twitter followers, was initially detained in late December in Romania's capital Bucharest, along with his brother Tristan and two Romanian women.All four won an appeal Friday, and will remain under house arrest until Apr. 29, Bolla said. None of the four has yet been formally indicted. The court ruled in favor of their immediate release. Prosecutors cannot challenge the appeal court's decision, which was final, Bolla added.As the brothers left the detention facility late Friday in Bucharest, Tristan Tate told a scrum of reporters that ""the judges today made the right decision.""""I respect what they've done for me and they will be vindicated in their decision, because I'm an innocent man and I can't wait to prove it,"" he said.Some Tate supporters outside the facility chanted ""Top-G, Top-G,"" using a popular moniker many of Andrew Tate's fans refer to him as.Later, standing outside what is believed to be the Tate brothers' home near the capital, Andrew Tate said he wanted to thank the judges ""who heard us today, because they were very attentive and they listened to us, and they let us free.""""I have no resentment in my heart for the country of Romania or for anybody else,"" he said. ""I just believe in the truth … I truly believe that justice will be served in the end. There is zero percent chance of me being convicted for something I've not done.""Tate, a professional kickboxer who has resided in Romania since 2017, was previously banned from various social media platforms for expressing misogynistic views and hate speech. He has repeatedly claimed Romanian prosecutors have no evidence and alleged their case is a ""political"" conspiracy designed to silence him.DIICOT said in a statement after the December arrests that it had identified six victims in the human trafficking case who were allegedly subjected to ""acts of physical violence and mental coercion"" and sexually exploited by members of the alleged crime group.The agency said victims were lured with pretenses of love and later intimidated, placed under surveillance and subjected to other control tactics while being coerced into engaging in pornographic acts for the financial gain of the crime group.In January, Romanian authorities descended on a compound near Bucharest linked with the Tate brothers and towed away a fleet of luxury cars that included a Rolls-Royce, a Ferrari and a Porsche. They reported seizing assets worth an estimated $3.9 million.Prosecutors have said that if they can prove the cars' owners gained money through illicit activities such as human trafficking, the assets would be used to cover the expenses of the investigation and to compensate victims.

The Vatican reported he had experienced difficulty breathing in the previous days.The Vatican on Thursday said that antibiotic treatment for bronchitis had resulted in a ""marked"" improvement in his health.In a video released by the Vatican, Francis was seen baptizing a hospitalized baby who is a few weeks old.After the mother tells Francis the boy's name, Miguel Angel, the pope uses a metal hospital tray usually employed to hold syringes to pour water over the sleeping baby's head, then tries to comfort the infant, who wakes up, wailing and seeming to try to swat away the pope's hand.Francis then asked the mother to dry her son's wet forehead. He then told her: ""When you go to your parish, say that the pope baptized him.""Francis was smiling and looked chipper as he visited children being treated at Gemelli for cancer and gave out large, wrapped chocolate Easter eggs.Earlier in the day, Francis sent a tweet on Friday possibly inspired by his current health challenge.""When experienced with faith, the trials and difficulties of life serve to purify our hearts, making them humbler and thus more and more open to God,"" Francis wrote. The tweet carried a hashtag for Lent, the period of the liturgical year stressing penitence and sacrifice in the run-up to the joyous Church celebration of Easter, which marks the Christian belief that Jesus rose from the dead after his crucifixion.The Vatican seemed keen to quickly dispel any worries about the pope's physical fitness to carry on fully with his duties. Nearly immediately after the announcement of a discharge date for Francis, the Vatican announced that the pope would meet the prime minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina on Monday in a private audience at the Apostolic Palace.Palm Sunday Mass usually draws tens of thousands of faithful, including many pilgrims from abroad, flocking to Rome for Holy Week.Francis had already largely stopped celebrating Mass at major Catholic Church holy days because of a chronic knee problem, but had continued to preside at the ceremonies and deliver homilies.The Holy Week appointments include a stamina-taxing late night Way of the Cross procession marked by prayers on Good Friday at the Colosseum in Rome and Easter Mass on April 9, which is traditionally followed by a long papal speech delivered from the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica.During Wednesday's hour-long public audience, Francis at times appeared visibly in pain when he moved about and was helped by aides.In July 2021, Francis underwent surgery at Gemelli Polyclinic after suffering from a narrowing of his colon. As a young man in Argentina, Francis had part of a lung removed.","Pope Francis, Rome",france news

The pontiff was treated with antibiotics administered intravenously, the Vatican said. Before departing, Francis had an emotional moment with a Rome couple whose 5-year-old daughter died Friday night at the hospital. Serena Subania, mother of Angelica, sobbed as she pressed her head into the chest of the pope, who put a hand on the woman's head. Francis seemed eager to linger with well-wishers. When a boy showed him his arm cast, the pope made a gesture as if to ask ""Do you have a pen?"" A papal aide handed Francis one, and the pope autographed the cast.The pontiff answered in a voice that was close to a whisper when reporters peppered him with questions, indicating he did feel chest pain, a symptom that convinced his medical staff to take him to the hospital Wednesday.Francis sat in the front seat of the white Fiat 500 car that drove him away from Gemelli Polyclinic. But instead of heading straight home, his motorcade sped right past Vatican City, according to an Associated Press photographer positioned outside the walled city-state. The pope was apparently headed to a Rome basilica that is a favorite of his. After he was discharged from the same hospital in July 2021 following intestinal surgery, Francis stopped to offer prayers of thanksgiving at St. Mary Major Basilica in Rome, which is home to an icon depicting the Virgin Mary.On Friday, Vatican officials said Francis would be at St. Peter's Square for Palm Sunday Mass to mark the start of Holy Week, which culminates on Easter, April 9.","Pope Francis, Religion, Rome, Vatican City",politics news
164,2023-04-02,CBS News,The U.S. could designate Mexican drug cartels as terrorist organizations — what would that mean?,"CBS News The powerful Mexican drug cartel responsible for the   — and the death of two of them — could be designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a hearing in March that the department is considering the designation for the Mexican drug cartels, which could include the Gulf Cartel, the cartel responsible for the attack. The foreign terrorist (FTO) designation has been attracting interest as a tool to use against the cartel in recent years.   The killing of the two American citizens crossed a ""red line,"" says Javed Ali, associate professor of practice at the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan. The Mexican drug cartels also traffic fentanyl, which is responsible for soaring opioid deaths in the U.S. — over 70,000 Americans died of synthetic opioid overdoses in 2021, most of them caused by fentanyl that comes from Mexico. Last year, the DEA seized enough fentanyl, more than 50 million fentanyl-laced pills and over 10,000 pounds of fentanyl powder, the vast majority of it at the southern border.Ali thinks now is the right time to designate the cartels as terrorist organizations, arguing that the U.S. is not currently using ""all the tools we have"" to counter them. In order to be labeled an FTO a group or network has to meet three criteria:There are  designated by the State Department, but none operate solely as drug cartels.An FTO designation unlocks the option for more foreign sanctions and , which makes it much easier to indict someone on lesser charges if affiliated with the terrorist organization. ""It certainly stigmatizes them,"" said Ali. ""I would think the last thing a Mexican drug cartel wants is to be labeled by the United States as a terrorist organization. That's bad for business.""The secretary of state makes the designation, in coordination with the attorney general and treasury secretary. Then, it is sent to Congress for review and if it raises no issue with the designation, after seven days, it's published in the Federal Register, making it official. Rep. Chip Roy, Republican of Texas, has introduced legislation that asks Blinken to target several cartels for FTO designation: the Gulf Cartel, Cartel Del Noreste, Cartel de Sinaloa and Cartel de Jalisco Nueva Generacion. In February, 21 Republican attorneys general called on President Joe Biden and Blinken to declare Mexican drug cartels as FTOs.It won't stop the cartels, Ali says, but it would get their attention — and the attention of anyone working with them. Because of the material support charge available to the U.S. after an FTO designation, the charges would be far more severe for even a low-level offense, such as giving money to the cartel. Donating to an foreign terrorist organization can result in a maximum sentence of up to 20 years in prison. Officially labeling the Mexican drug cartels as terrorists emphasizes the national security threat they pose and confers authorizations the U.S. hopes would have a chilling effect.  But there are potential disadvantages to making the designation. It could adversely affect U.S.-Mexico relations. ""We have enormous authority already in dealing with drug trafficking organizations, in terms of all the policing capabilities we have to deal with them, particularly in the United States,"" says Pamela Starr, an international relations professor at the University of Southern California. ""What it would do, however, is undermine bilateral cooperation with Mexico, and that would dramatically undermine our capacity to deal with the challenges in Mexico."" And the FTO designation might also damage Mexico's appeal as a tourist destination by contributing to the perception that it's less safe. Starr also warns the designation could radicalize drug cartels further. ""My real concern is that if you treat organized crime as if it were a terrorist organization, they might begin to employ terrorist tactics,"" Starr said. In a worst case scenario, the cartel could increase targeting of U.S. citizens, according to Ali. But Ali argues the FTO designation for Mexican drug cartels is worthwhile. ""This level of activity is absolutely having an impact on our national security, more from the flow of drugs in the U.S. than the targeting of Americans in Mexico. But it still gives you another tool. Why not use it when the status quo doesn't seem to be working?""","Antony Blinken, Drug Cartels, Mexico, Fentanyl",environment news

When images appeared online showing the 86-year-old pontiff atypically wrapped up against the elements in a stylish white puffer jacket and silver bejewelled crucifix, they soon went viral, racking up millions of views on social media platforms.  The picture, first published Friday on Reddit along with several others, was in fact a fake. It was an artificial intelligence rendering generated using the AI software Midjourney. While there are some inconsistencies in the final rendered images — for example, the pope's left hand where it is holding a water bottle looks distorted and his skin has an overly sharp appearance — many people online were fooled into thinking they were real pictures.The revelation that they had been dupped left some Twitter users shocked and confused.""I thought the pope's puffer jacket was real and didn't give it a second thought,"" tweeted model and author Chrissy Teigen. ""No way am I surviving the future of technology.""  The ""pope in the puffer jacket"" was just the latest in a series of ""deepfake"" images created with AI software. Another recent example was pictures of former President Donald Trump that  him in police custody. Although the creator made it clear that they were produced as an exercise in the use of AI, the images, combined with , went viral and created and entirely fraudulent but potentially dangerous narrative.Midjourney, DALL E2, OpenAI and Dream Studio are among the software options available to anyone wishing to produce photo-realistic images using nothing more than text prompts — no specialist training required. As this type of software becomes more widespread, AI developers are  to inform viewers of the authenticity, or otherwise, of images. CBS News' ""Sunday Morning""  that Microsoft's chief scientific officer Eric Horvitz, the co-creator of the spam email filter, was among those trying to crack the conundrum, predicting that if technology isn't developed to enable people to easily detect fakes within a decade or so ""most of what people will be seeing, or quite a lot of it, will be synthetic. We won't be able to tell the difference.""In the meantime, Henry Ajder, who presents a BBC radio series entitled, ""The Future Will be Synthesised,"" cautioned in a newspaper interview that it was ""already very, very hard to determine whether"" some of the images being created were real.""It gives us a sense of how bad actors, agents spreading disinformation, could weaponize these tools,"" Ajder told the British newspaper, I.There's clear evidence of this happening already. Last March, video emerged appearing to show Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy telling his troops to lay down their arms and surrender. It was bad quality and quickly outed as a fake, but it may have been merely an opening salvo in a new information war.So, while a picture may speak a thousand words, it may be worth asking who's actually doing the talking.","Pope Francis, Vatican City, Artificial Intelligence, AI, ChatGPT",science news
166,2023-04-02,CBS News,"As Congress eyes a TikTok ban, what could happen to the social media platform?","MoneyWatch TikTok CEO 's testimony before Congress on Thursday appears to have done little to allay Washington's concerns about whether the social media platform poses a threat to Americans' privacy and to national security. In five hours of grueling , lawmakers seemed skeptical that the app, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, could be made safe for domestic users. ""We  don't think anything said by Mr. Chew alleviated concerns about   sensitive TikTok data eventually reaching the Chinese government,"" CFRA  analyst Angelo Zino said in a note. ""[A]n outright  sale or ban is  looking increasingly likely in the next 12-18 months.""TikTok is now at a crossroads: Split up and stay in the U.S., or face a possible ban.Here's where the company could go from here and what that means for TikTok users.  Prior to the TikTok chief exective's testimony this week, ByteDance had planned to remain a single company, while segregating data for American users of the app into a separate U.S.-based facility run by Oracle and routing any requests for that info through a data-security board. However, lawmakers weren't convinced that the project, dubbed ""Project Texas,"" would protect U.S. users.The  Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which  reviews transactions that could affect national security, has been pressuring ByteDance to spin off its U.S. subsidiary or sell it to an American company, CBS News has confirmed. However, China pushed back against this possibility Thursday, with a  ""China will firmly oppose"" any forced sale of the app.The RESTRICT Act, a bipartisan bill introduced in the Senate this month,  the U.S. Commerce Secretary to ban foreign technology companies, as well as encourages the intelligence service to declassify information on potential risks. One law and technology expert said any TikTok ban wouldn't kick in immediately, since the video platform and some users would likely challenge it in court. If a ban survived the lawsuits, it would most likely result in Apple and Google, who run the vast majority of smartphones in the U.S., removing TikTok from their app stores and turning off app updates. ""Everyone who's installed it would still have it. But my guess is that for everyone who has it on their phone, it would stop working in various ways,"" said Kentaro Toyama, a professor at the University of Michigan's School of Information. Because apps are constantly being updated, turning off updates would eventually make it unusable by becoming incompatible with the phone's operating system. If Apple or Google wanted to take a harder line, it would theoretically be possible, although difficult, for them to push a software update to phones that would stop TikTok from working, noted Caitlin Chin, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. To be sure, users would still be able to get around the bans to view TikTok content and download it from other sources by using virtual private networks that mask the location of a device. But for most users ""who are not technically savvy, [a ban] would essentially eliminate TikTok,"" Chin said.One option the U.S. government may be encouraging is for TikTok to spin off from its Beijing parent so it can be acquired by a U.S. company. But the list of suitors for TikTok could be short, with the service likely costing between $40 billion and $100 billion, according to , while any deal would likely attract scrutiny from antitrust enforcers.""Any company interested in buying TikTok needs to be very wealthy and have a high enough risk tolerance, because there's a good chance this deal is not going through,"" Chin said.She added, ""Any acquisition of this size is almost certainly going to raise antitrust concerns. That rules out Meta and YouTube, which is owned by Google. I don't think it would be easy."" Industry analysts told Insider that both Microsoft and Oracle were potential buyers. U.S.-based Oracle is currently working with TikTok on its efforts to segregate Americans' data to its servers. It had previously put together a bid for TikTok in 2020, when the  tried to force a divestiture.During the Trump administration, the federal government moved to ban network hardware made by Huawei and ZTE, two Chinese telecom gear , on national security grounds. In 2020, CFIUS also pressured the Chinese owner of Grindr to sell the  dating app to a U.S.-based company. But a move to outright ban a software program would be unprecedented, lawyers and technologists said. ""I can't even think of a precedent where you have a platform with more than 100 million users out there all of a sudden get banned,"" said CFRA's Zino. ""This would absolutely draw the ire of the Chinese government."" The American Civil Liberties Union, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and other civil liberties groups strongly oppose the bill banning TikTok. ""We're talking about not just the hundreds of millions of Americans expressing themselves on the platform, but the many more who are getting information from it,"" said Ryan Calo, a law and technology professor at the University of Washington. ""It would be obviously unconstitutional for the United States to shut down communications with American citizens because they disagree with the content.""The government's concerns fall into three major groups, Calo said.Politicians have said that, as a subsidiary of a Chinese company, TikTok could be pressured to hand over sensitive information on Americans to the Chinese government or be used by China's leadership as a propaganda tool. For instance, China could purportedly use TikTok to gather sensitive information about Americans' likes and dislikes for political purposes — as happened with user information on Facebook in the . The app could also potentially be used to install spyware or other malicious software on Americans' phones, Calo said, or to launch phishing attacks.There's no evidence that TikTok is being used maliciously, nor that propaganda is being funneled through the app, experts told CBS MoneyWatch. However, the app has used some questionable practices. TikTok's operating documents, revealed by  and The Guardian in 2020, showed that moderators were instructed to suppress certain political discussions, such as mentions of Tiananmen Square or posts that were otherwise embarrassing to Chinese government officials. The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that trackers made by TikTok's parent company  on 30 state government websites. Tracking pixels, also offered by Meta,  and smaller websites, helps site administrators measure the effectiveness of ads, but they could also relay sensitive information about a person's online activity.What's more, executives at TikTok accessed personal information of  in an attempt to locate a sensitive information leak, the New York Times has reported. (American companies, notably Uber, have been guilty of .) TikTok  it fired the employees involved and would cooperate with any government investigation.Experts say that, without restricting data collection more broadly, changing TikTok's owner is unlikely to accomplish much.""Passing a bill specific to TikTok isn't going to do very much, but the best thing it can do is get people talking on the national level about privacy,"" said Anton Dahbura, co-director of the Johns Hopkins University Institute for Assured Autonomy. ""Until policies change, there are uncountable ways to obtain user data.""He added, ""We need to look more closely at the marketplace for user data and determine what's OK and what's not.""Civil liberties advocates have seized on the TikTok debate to push Congress for data privacy laws, which it has so far failed to do despite bipartisan concerns about widespread data collection. ""The No. 1 thing Congress can do to support privacy is support stronger regulations across all industries,"" Chin said. ""Mobile apps in the U.S. are very under-regulated. They build their business on collecting vast amounts of personal information, and instead of charging users they monetize their information and sell advertising based upon it.""There's nothing to legally stop either Grindr or any other U.S. company from sharing information with just about anybody,"" she said.","Social Media, Federal Government of the United States, China, United States Federal Government Shutdown of 2018, TikTok, ByteDance, Shou Zi Chew",environment news
167,2023-04-02,CBS News,Behind the making of Panama's $100-a-cup coffee,"CBS News Panama grows some of the world's best coffee, but no brew may be more coveted than the ""Geisha"" varietal grown in remote parts of the country. The Panamanian version of the coffee, which can sell for up to $100 a cup in the United States, is among the world's most expensive. In western Panama's Chiriqui Province, coffee grower Ratibor Hartmann, his son Rabitor Junior, and coffee importer Ellen Fan took CBS News behind the scenes of their operation. The estate where they grow the coffee is located on the side of a mountain, where altitude and volcanic soil make it the perfect place to grow the famous beans. Ratibor said that breezes from the Pacific and Caribbean grace the mountain's slopes, adding to the flavor. Hartmann describes Geisha coffee as ""very juicy, very sweet,"" while Fan describes it as having ""fruit notes like candy and grapes."" ""This varietal, Panamanian Geisha, is the best,"" added Fan. Geisha coffee beans actually originate from Ethiopia. They were originally called ""Gesha"" beans, named after the region in Ethiopia where they originated, but the misspelling stuck. The bean made its way to Panama thanks to an experiment by the late Price Peterson and his family, who found that Geisha beans could survive some unfavorable weather. That experiment yielded a coffee unlike any they had ever tasted, and in 2004, they entered the coffee in a ""Best of Panama"" competition. ""It was no competition,"" said Daniel Peterson, Price Peterson's son. ""Judges, international judges that had been exposed to coffees around the world just - they fell in love with it."" Ever since then, Daniel and Rachel Peterson have been working to top that. They've experimented with different varities, fermentation and drying methods, and more. Some of their batches sell for more than $500 a pound, due to the limited supply of the beans and the estate's meticulous handling of the prized products. Panamanian chef Charlie Collins said that sales of Geisha coffee have helped draw tourists to Panama and to the city of Boquete, which is near the Peterson farm. One of his baristas, Kenneth Duarte, loved the coffee so much that he learned the fine art of brewing it.""Business has increased, it's been very good for the community of Boquete, but it's also been very good for Panama,"" Collins said. Manuel Bojorquez is a CBS News national correspondent based in Miami.

No one has been arrested in Norway.Police spokeswoman Grete Lien Metlid was quoted by NTB as saying that it was the largest seizure ever in Norway. She said that it was too early to say whether the cocaine was intended for the Norwegian market, or if Norway was being used as a transit point.""We cannot rule out that there are larger networks with connections to Norway,"" Lien Metlid told NTB.The fruit boxes had arrived at a warehouse facility of Bama, a large Norwegian fruit and vegetable wholesaler, company spokesman Pia Gulbrandsen said in a statement.The previous largest seizures of cocaine in Norway was in 2013 when 153 kilograms (337 pounds), were seized, and in 2013 when 145 kilograms (319 pounds) of cocaine were hidden in banana boxes, the news agency said.","Copenhagen, Norway, Cocaine",france news
170,2023-04-02,CBS News,Taliban close women-run Afghan station for playing music,"AP A women-run radio station in Afghanistan's northeast has been shut down for playing music during the holy month of Ramadan, a Taliban official said Saturday.Sadai Banowan, which means women's voice in Dari, is Afghanistan's only women-run station and started 10 years ago. It has eight staff, six of them female.Moezuddin Ahmadi, the director for Information and Culture in Badakhshan province, said the station violated the ""laws and regulations of the Islamic Emirate"" several times by broadcasting songs and music during Ramadan and was shuttered because of the breach.""If this radio station accepts the policy of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan and gives a guarantee that it will not repeat such a thing again, we will allow it to operate again,"" said Ahmadi.Station head Najia Sorosh denied there was any violation, saying there was no need for the closure and called it a conspiracy. The Taliban ""told us that you have broadcast music. We have not broadcast any kind of music,"" she said.Sorosh said at 11:40 a.m. on Thursday representatives from the Ministry of Information and Culture and the Vice and Virtue Directorate arrived at the station and shut it down. She said station staff have contacted Vice and Virtue but officials there said they do not have any additional information about the closing.Many journalists lost their jobs after the Taliban takeover in August 2021. Media outlets closed over lack of funds or because staff left the country, according to the Afghan Independent Journalists Association.The Taliban have barred women from most forms of employment and education beyond the sixth grade, including university. There is no official ban on music. During their previous rule in the late 1990s, the Taliban barred most television, radio and newspapers in the country.","taliban, Afghanistan, Crime",politics news
171,2023-04-02,CBS News,"Latvian foreign minister urges NATO not to ""overreact"" to Russia's plans for tactical nukes in Belarus","CBS News Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkēvičs has urged the U.S.-led NATO alliance not to ""overreact"" to President Vladimir Putin's that Russia will deploy  in Belarus, which shares borders with both Latvia — a NATO member — and Ukraine.""Let's face it, Russian nuclear weapons have already been deployed in Kaliningrad, near our borders, even before [Russia's 2014 invasion of] Crimea started,"" Rinkēvičs told CBS News. ""I would view this as some kind of bargaining chip. Something to blackmail our societies."" He said he ""would not over-dramatize"" this move, but called for additional sanctions against Belarus and Russia. Rinkēvičs said he did not consider Belarus a sovereign state, but rather a ""part of a Russian military district."" Putin said over the weekend that Russia would deploy nuclear weapons in Belarus on fighter jets and Iskander hypersonic missiles, which have a range of around 300 miles.Rinkēvičs also expressed hopes for an expanded NATO, when the alliance meets in July. He said he'd like to see 32 members at the summit in Lithuania, alluding to Finland and Sweden's stalled bids to be ratified as the NATO's newest members. Finland inched a step closer to NATO membership after the Hungarian parliament ratified the country's bid Monday. The other member holding out on backing that bid, Turkey, is expected to ratify Finland soon, after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his country would start the process. Sweden remains blocked because Turkey refuses to back its bid until disputes between the two nations are resolved. Turkey has accused Sweden of harboring members of Kurdish militant groups that Ankara considers terrorists. Rinkēvičs said he hoped the ""allies can resolve outstanding issues so Sweden will also be able to participate.""He also said that support for Ukraine, as it continues to hold the Russian invasion at bay, has only grown stronger in his country, and he argued that now is not the time for a peace deal. Peace negotiations would only allow Russia ""to regroup, to get stronger, and to resume"" its assault, said Rinkēvičs. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned earlier this week that calls for a ceasefire in Ukraine could be part of a ""cynical trap"" supported by Russian allies. As for Russian conscripts trying to avoid being sent to the front lines by seeking refuge in Latvia, Rinkēvičs said Latvia's door was closed. Latvia and other Baltic states instituted a policy prohibiting fleeing conscripts from entry into the countries because they pose a security risk. ""They are not anti-war people. They are not anti-Putin people. They are not ready to stop the war,"" he said, ""and in that case, we are not ready to accept them."" But there continue to be pathways for civilians to enter Latvia from Russia, Rinkēvičs noted. In December, Latvia canceled the license of the exiled Russian television station TV Rain, after deeming the outlet a national security threat. TV Rain came under criticism after its reporters referred to Russian conscripts as ""our military,"" and the network showed a map that portrayed Ukraine's occupied Crimean Peninsula as part of Russia.Rinkēvičs called the Russian journalists' remarks ""completely unacceptable,"" but did not comment further regarding the pending TV Rain litigation.","Ukraine, Russia",russia news

That includes criminal proceedings against Baldwin and movie armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, who have pleaded not guilty to  in Hutchins' death.Halls appeared briefly by video to waive his right to challenge the negligence charge, as state District Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer approved terms of a plea agreement with prosecutors.Defense attorney Lisa Torraco urged the court not to impose a prison sentence - the maximum possible penalty was 6 months behind bars - noting that Halls was ""extremely traumatized and ""rattled"" with guilt.Hutchins died shortly after she was shot on Oct. 21, 2021, during rehearsals on a film-set ranch on the outskirts of Santa Fe. Baldwin was pointing a pistol at Hutchins when the weapon went off; a single live round killed her and wounded director Joel Souza.If convicted of involuntary manslaughter, Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed could face a maximum penalty of 18 months in prison and fines.Torraco said Halls had checked the rounds in the revolver before handing it to Baldwin to see whether they were dummies or blanks with an explosive. She said it was ""never in anyone's imagination"" that live rounds would be in the gun.""When Ms. Gutierrez-Reed brought the firearm ... on set into the church, he did check the firearm,"" she said of Halls. ""He wouldn't have even thought that there was a live round in that, in that gun. ... And he, like many others, is extremely traumatized.""But prosecutor Kari Morrissey said Halls, a veteran filmmaker of more than 30 years, failed in his duty as the last line of defense for firearms safety, and that the fatal shooting took place after two earlier weapons misfires on set.""Mr. Halls did not check every round that was in the gun to confirm that it was a dummy round and not a live round,"" she said. ""He then handed the gun to Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Baldwin began to practice his cross draw. And during that action of practicing the cross draw, the gun went off. And obviously Mrs. Hutchins was struck by the bullet and was killed. That is the factual basis for Mr. Halls taking the no-contest plea to the unsafe handling of a deadly weapon.""In separate regulatory proceedings, workplace safety authorities have asserted Halls shared responsibility for identifying and correcting any hazardous conditions related to firearms safety in the movie's production.Halls' sentencing took place on the 30th anniversary of the . The son of martial-arts legend Bruce Lee was hit by a .44-caliber slug from a gun that was supposed to have fired a blank while filming ""The Crow.""A weekslong preliminary hearing in May will decide whether evidence against Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed is sufficient to proceed to trial.When the charges were announced, CBS News legal contributor Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, said it was possible the case may not go to a jury. ""At every step along the way … if there is a plea deal on the table, Alec Baldwin can consider a plea deal,"" she said.In her sentencing, Judge Marlowe Sommer confirmed with Halls that he would ""testify truthfully in all hearings, trials, or settings involving any and all defendants and co-defendants in this matter.""Santa Fe's district attorney this week appointed two special prosecutors, Morrissey and Jason Lewis.The original special prosecutor, Andrea Reeb,  in the initial filing of charges against Baldwin and objections that her role as a state legislator created conflicting responsibilities.","Alec Baldwin, New Mexico",france news
174,2023-04-02,CBS News,The crime scene evidence that convicted Alex Murdaugh,"CBS NEWS On March 2, 2023, the six-week murder trial of South Carolina attorney came to a surprisingly swift conclusion. See some of the evidence that led the jury to find him guilty after just under three hours of deliberation. Murdaugh intends to , according to documents filed on March 9, 2023 by his legal team.On June 7, 2021, Maggie and Paul Murdaugh were found dead at these dog kennels on the Murdaugh family property off of Moselle Road in Colleton County, South Carolina. The property was known simply as ""Moselle.""Alex Murdaugh, the patriarch of the family, became a suspect in the crime early in the investigation. In July 2022, he was indicted on two counts of murder for the deaths of his wife and son. His trial began in January 2023 and lasted six weeks. In the first weeks of the trial, the jury was shown Alex Murdaugh's interviews with police. In this one from late on the night of the murders, Murdaugh tells investigators about finding the bodies of his wife and child at the kennels.""When I came back here, I mean, I pulled up and I could see them, and, you know, I knew something was bad,"" he said. ""... I called 911 pretty much right away.""When police responded to Murdaugh's 911 call that night, they found a gruesome scene. Blood and other biological matter were strewn across the ground and walls.During the trial, attorneys showed this photo and other crime scene images to the jury to explain the nature of the crime and demonstrate the angles of the weapons when the shots were fired. When police responded to Murdaugh's 911 call that night, they found a gruesome scene. Blood and other biological matter were strewn across the ground and walls.During the trial, attorneys showed this photo and other crime scene images to the jury to explain the nature of the crime and demonstrate the angles of the weapons when the shots were fired. These shells and others like them were found at the scene. They were photographed, secured, and labeled for future examination. With the help of shells like these, investigators were able to determine exactly what types of guns caused Paul and Maggie's wounds.Investigators argued that the guns used in the fatal shootings of Paul and Maggie were guns belonging to the Murdaugh family, similar to the one pictured here. The actual murder weapons were never found.""Family weapons were used to commit this crime,"" said Prosecutor Creighton Waters in his closing argument.The Murdaughs also kept stocks of ammunition at home for their various hunting weapons. This box, found on a bookcase in the Murdaugh home, contains 300 Blackout cartridges - the type of ammunition used to kill MaggieThe Murdaughs had many firearms on the property, as they were avid hunters. Inside the main house at Moselle the family had a room that investigators called the ""gun room,"" a storage space for the Murdaugh family's large gun collection. This photo of the gun room was shown at trialDr. Ellen Riemer, who conducted the autopsies, testified at trial that Maggie Murdaugh was shot four or five times with a 300 Blackout rifle. Here, she shows the jury the location of Maggie's wounds on an autopsy diagram.Paul Murdaugh sustained injuries from a different type of gun   — a shotgun. Dr. Reimer showed the jury a diagram that illustrated Paul's two wounds. He was shot first in the chest, then a second shot entered through his shoulder and exited through his head. It was the second shot that would prove fatal.In part because the victims were shot with different guns, at trial the defense proposed a theory that there were two different shooters that night.The defense also used the angles of the bullet holes found at the crime scene to support the idea that there were two shooters. SLED Agent Melinda Worley points out the holes on a diagram in this image from her testimony.When the prosecution questioned Agent Worley, she said the two-shooter theory was not the only possible explanation for the position of the bullet holes. Another possible interpretation was that there was one shooter who was moving.A forensic engineer who testified for the defense created this crime scene reconstruction image to show the jury a possible two-shooter scenario. He said that based on the trajectory of the bullets, the shooters must have been short - between 5'2"" and 5'4"". Because Alex Murdaugh is 6'4"", the defense argued he was too tall to have committed this crime.Prosecution experts countered that it was not possible to conclusively determine the height of the shooter, and this reconstruction was just one of many possible scenarios.Cell phone evidence would be just as important as the crime scene in solving the Murdaugh case. Investigators took Alex Murdaugh's phone, pictured here, and pored through his texts, phone calls, and other data looking for clues.What they found was as important as what they didn't find   — namely, multiple phone calls that Alex had made to Maggie. Records of those showed up on Maggie's phone, but the corresponding records were missing from Alex's.When investigators first arrived at the scene, Maggie Murdaugh's phone was missing. But with the help of the ""Find My iPhone"" feature, it was located the next day along a road not far from the Moselle property.Experts who examined GPS data from the phones and Alex's vehicle said that on the night of the murders, Alex Murdaugh drove past the spot where Maggie's phone would later be found. The prosecution argued that Alex Murdaugh threw Maggie's phone out the window of his car in an attempt to dispose of evidence. Perhaps the most significant piece of evidence came from another phone   — 's.Alex Murdaugh claimed for months that he had not been at the kennels on the night of the murders. But in a video taken on Paul's phone only minutes before the murders likely took place, Alex Murdaugh's voice can be heard, placing him at the kennel that night. This is a screenshot of that video, showing Paul's hand and a friend's dog in the kennel.In Paul Murdaugh's kennel video, Alex Murdaugh's voice can be heard in the background calling to Bubba, one of the Murdaugh family's dogs, who had a chicken in his mouth. In an interview with CBS News, Prosecutor Creighton Waters gave Bubba some credit for helping with the case. ""If Bubba didn't have that chicken maybe we would not have heard Alex's voice on there,"" he said. ""But we did, and that I think really helped the jury understand."" When he took the stand in his own defense, Alex Murdaugh admitted that it  his voice on the video, and that he had lied to investigators about not being at the scene of the crime that night. He claimed that his decades-long opioid addiction had made him paranoid, and he feared he would be suspected if he told the truth.The prosecution pointed out that Murdaugh's lie about the kennels was another in a long string of lies dating back years. Alex Murdaugh admitted on the stand that over the years he had embezzled money from his law firm, misled his clients, and lied to his family about his addiction.""Not a single person close to him hadn't been lied to by this man,"" Prosecutor Creighton Waters said in his closing argument. "".He was lying to you … just like he's lied to everyone close to him.""Throughout the six-week trial, the prosecution repeatedly accused Alex Murdaugh of being a ""family annihilator"" who brutally murdered his wife Maggie and son Paul, who was only 22 years old. On Thursday, March 2, 2023, the jury . He was sentenced to two consecutive life sentences.","48 Hours, Alex Murdaugh, Trial",environment news
175,2023-04-02,CBS News,"Recent cosmic explosion likely the ""brightest of all time,"" NASA says","CBS News NASA astronomers recently spotted a burst of radiation that was quickly crowned the ""BOAT"": the brightest of all time. The source of the radiation, which NASA said ""swept through the solar system"" on Oct. 9, 2022, was a gamma-ray burst, the most powerful kind of explosion. NASA  that the gamma-ray burst triggered spacecraft detectors. Researchers and astronomers around the world have spent the past several months looking at and understanding the burst, which was so bright that it ""effectively blinded"" most space instruments used to measure such bursts, NASA said. Information about the burst was reconstructed using data from astronomers in the United States. That analysis was compared with observations from Russian and Chinese astronomers. The data shows that the burst was ""70 times brighter than any yet seen,"" NASA said. Eric Burns, an assistant professor of physics and astronomy at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, said that this was ""likely"" the brightest such burst ""since human civilization began."" His research, which analyzed more than 7,000 gamma-ray bursts, found that these events only occur once every 10,000 years. The signal from this burst, experts found, had been traveling for about 1.9 billion years before reaching Earth. ""Astronomers think these bursts represent the birth cries of black holes formed when the cores of massive stars collapse under their own weight. As it quickly ingests the surrounding matter, the black hole blasts out jets in opposite directions containing particles accelerated to near the speed of light,"" NASA said. ""These jets pierce through the star, emitting X-rays and gamma rays as they stream into space."" Astronomers are now watching for a supernova, which typically occurs within a few weeks of this type of gamma-ray burst. The supernova still hasn't been seen, which may be because of the location of the explosion: The gamma-ray burst appeared in a part of the sky that has thick dust clouds which can dim light. ""We cannot say conclusively that there is a supernova, which is surprising given the burst's brightness,"" said Andrew Levan, a professor of astrophysics at  in Nijmegen, Netherlands, in NASA's news release. Levan is using multiple data sources to study the area. ""If it's there, it's very faint. We plan to keep looking, but it's possible the entire star collapsed straight into the black hole instead of exploding."" The gamma-ray burst has also given astronomers the opportunity to study the jets that appeared in its wake and distant dust clouds that were illuminated by the burst, and consider what NASA called a ""big cosmic question."" ""We think of black holes as all-consuming things, but do they also return power back to the universe?"" asked Michela Negro, an astrophysicist at the , and NASA's  in Greenbelt, in the agency's news release. Answers to that, NASA said, will take more time. A second team is studying measurements similar to the one Negro's team took, but it may be possible to show that the burst was powered by the energy of a magnetic field. Kerry Breen is a news editor and reporter for CBS News.

176,2023-04-02,CBS News,Could an Alabama woman have shot herself twice?,"CBS NEWS On May 2, 2017, 37-year-old  discovered his wife, 32-year-old , slumped over in the driver's seat of her own van outside of their family's home in Cullman, Alabama   — about 50 miles north of Birmingham. ""My wife is shot,"" Crawford told the 911 dispatcher. When Cullman County Sheriff's deputies arrived at the scene, they found Tiffiney with a pink revolver in her left hand, which Jason said she kept in her driver's side door for protectionBody camera footage showed what the sheriff's deputies saw that night at the scene. When one of the deputies approached the van and checked Tiffiney's left wrist for a pulse, her pink revolver fell out of her hand.Jason Crawford explained to the deputies that he and Tiffiney had been arguing. Crawford said he wasn't going to let her inside the house that night, so he was gathering up some of her clothes. ""And the last thing I remember, she said she loved me, and I was going in the house,"" Crawford told the deputies. ""And I heard a shot, a scream and then another shot.""Tiffiney Crawford had two gunshot wounds to her head   — one shot was to the left side of her jaw and the other was to her left temple. At least one sheriff's deputy at the scene believed she had taken her own life. The paramedics tried to revive Tiffiney, but it was too late. ""And they came over and told me that she was dead,"" Jason Crawford told ""48 Hours."" ""It just made me feel sick in my stomach.""Before her death, Tiffiney and Jason had been married for more than six years. But when they first started dating, it wasn't exactly a fairy-tale beginning. Jason Crawford had already been divorced for several years after he says his first wife cheated on him. Tiffiney was also married at the time. But that didn't change the way Crawford felt about her. ""I thought she was striking and beautiful. She was outgoing. A lot of things I wasn't,"" Crawford said. Eventually Tiffiney got divorced.In                  2011, Jason and Tiffiney got married and she became a stepmom to Jason's son Logan from his previous marriage. The couple would also have a son of their own shortly after and then a daughter the following year. And as the kids grew up, Tiffiney was very active in their lives. ""She was very involved with her children. And seeing that they were happy,"" Tiffiney's mother Cheryl McGucken told ""48 Hours.""When McGucken learned about her daughter's death, she said, ""I felt like I was kind of frozen in time."" And since Tiffiney's passing, life hasn't been the same for McGucken. ""Tiffiney was an individual that had a huge heart, and she just wanted to engulf everyone around her and help them find joy,"" she said.Tiffiney's love for helping people is why McGucken says her daughter started a support group on Facebook called ""Mothers Helping Mothers.""""She saw a vision that there were ... other mothers … that needed somebody to talk to,"" McGucken said. ""And that group took off like a wildfire and spread all over the country."" At the time of Tiffiney's death, the group had about 9,000 members.On the night of the shooting, Jason and Tiffiney's 5-year-old son and 4-year-old daughter were both asleep inside the house. Crawford said his then-14-year-old son Logan was also in the house and that he told Logan to call his grandparents to get there quickly. Once Crawford's parents arrived, the sheriff's deputies at the scene realized that Jason was the son of Ronda Crawford, pictured left with Jason,  an office manager at the Cullman County Sheriff's Office.Because the incident involved one of his employee's close relatives, Cullman County Sheriff Matt Gentry visited the Crawford scene that night. Sheriff Gentry told ""48 Hours"" that once he arrived, he spoke to the coroner and the coroner told him that Tiffiney's death appeared to be a suicide. ""He said, 'The only weird thing is there's two shots.'"" Gentry decided that because of Jason's mother's connection to his office, he wanted an autopsy done.After the sheriff's investigators finished processing the scene that night, Sheriff Gentry decided to turn the case over to the Alabama State Bureau of Investigation the following morning. Joe Parrish, pictured, was the state agent assigned to the case. ""I could have told our guys to work it,"" Gentry said. But he felt there was a potential conflict of interest because of Jason's mother Ronda's connection to his office. ""I want full transparency,"" the sheriff said.The first thing Joe Parrish did was obtain a search warrant for Tiffiney Crawford's van. But there was a problem: the sheriff's office released the van to the Crawford family the night before. By the time Parrish got to it — less than 24 hours after Tiffiney died — it had already been cleaned by Jason's family members. They had received permission from the sheriff's office. ""There was nothing of evidentiary value to the van,"" Sheriff Gentry told ""48 Hours"". ""Every bit of evidence that was needed was taken.""When Parrish began looking further into the Crawford case, he quickly learned that Tiffiney had been having an affair with another man.Lyndsy Luke, left, was a close friend of Tiffiney's and one of the few people who knew about the affair. Luke said Tiffiney told her she was making plans to leave Jason and that she got a job at a local grocery store to save up money for a new life. Luke has also never believed that Tiffiney would take her own life. ""Suicidal people don't make plans,"" Luke told ""48 Hours"". ""There was nothing suicidal about her.""When Joe Parrish reviewed the body camera footage and the 911 call, he never heard Jason Crawford mention the affair. Parrish said he also thought something was off about the 911 call. ""It was very cold,"" he said. ""It didn't sound like somebody that was worried about his wife.""And there was one question that the 911 dispatcher repeatedly asked that Crawford wouldn't answer. ""'Who shot your wife?'"" Parrish recalled. ""He was avoiding the question.""A week after Tiffiney died, and with her autopsy still pending, Parrish brought Jason Crawford in for questioning. During that interview, Crawford said that in the months leading up to Tiffiney's death, he noticed a change in her. ""She started drinking more,"" Crawford told Parrish. Crawford also confirmed that Tiffiney was right-handed, which was key information for Parrish given that the gun was found in Tiffiney's left hand.During this interview, Crawford also shared that on the day of Tiffiney's death, he discovered messages on their computer suggesting that she was having an affair. He said he called Tiffiney to confront her with what he'd found, but he said she denied it. A few hours later, Tiffiney came home with their two kids. Crawford brought them inside the house and told Tiffiney to stay outside.Jason Crawford explained to Parrish that he and Tiffiney argued for more than an hour and when he remained insistent that Tiffiney wasn't allowed inside the house, he said she asked him to get her work clothes. ""I was going in the house. I just shut the door when I heard shot, a scream and then another shot,"" he told Parrish. Crawford said he then ran back outside, pulled the driver's door open and called 911. After the interview ended, Crawford was free to go.About a week later, Jason rawford was brought back in for more questioning and agreed to take a polygraph test. ""Your reactions were off the chain, OK?"" the polygraph examiner told Crawford. But again, that interview ended without an arrest. A backlog in the State's ballistics lab would delay Tiffiney Crawford's autopsy results for about a year. But when the report came back in March 2018, the case was ruled a homicide. Dr. Valerie Green was the medical examiner who performed the autopsy. ""The thing that made me think that there could be something else going on with this case is … that gunshot wound on the left side of Ms. Crawford's head,"" Dr. Green said.Dr. Green explained that based on the absence of gunpowder particles and abrasions around the left temple wound, she concluded that the shot was fired from at least 10 inches away. ""That's indicating that … she's holding her arm outward beyond 10 inches and trying to shoot herself,"" Dr. Green said. And she believed that to be unlikely, especially because Jason reported that he found Tiffiney in the driver's seat of her own van with the gun in her left hand and the car door closed.And there was something else that concerned Dr. Green about the van. ""I remember looking at pictures of the driver's side door,"" Green told ""48 Hours."" ""And I didn't see any blood on that door. I didn't see any blood on the glass."" This led Green to believe that the door was not closed when Tiffiney was shot. ""And I think that that door is open because he was standing there,"" Green said.With a homicide ruling from the medical examiner, investigator Joe Parrish and Jeff Roberts, the Cullman County assistant district attorney at the time, took the case to a grand jury. That grand jury came back with an indictment for murder against Jason Crawford. On May 21, 2018, just over a year after Tiffiney's death, Crawford surrendered at the Cullman County Sheriff's Office. But he was only in custody for 30 minutes before he was released on bondRobert Tuten, left, and Nickolas Weatherly became Jason Crawford's's defense attorneys. ""We don't believe Jason is guilty at all,"" Tuten told ""48 Hours."" ""They did not see blood or anything on him. They found nothing that would indicate he had fired a firearm recently."" But Crawford was never tested for gunshot residue on the night of the shooting, and his house was never searched for bloody clothing.  His attorneys also believe that Crawford was inside the house when the shots rang out, especially because his oldest son Logan told investigators that he heard his father come back inside right before the first gunshot.But prosecutor Jeff Roberts and his assistant Debra Ball were confident in their case against Crawford. ""I couldn't figure out who else did it. He's the only one who had a motive to do it,"" Roberts said. However, Roberts did acknowledge that it would be tough to overcome the fact that there was at least one officer at the scene who thought the shooting was consistent with a suicide. And there was also no direct physical evidence that linked Jason to Tiffiney's death.In November 2022, more than five years after Tiffiney's death, Jason Crawford, pictured with defense attorney Robert Tiuten, went on trial for her murder. The prosecution played the 911 call for the jury and showed them some of the body camera footage. Prosecutor Jeff Roberts argued what he believed to be Crawford's alleged motive: anger over his wife's affair. One of Tiffiney's friends testified that after learning that                  Tiffiney had been cheating, Jason called her and said, ""He couldn't go through this again,"" referencing how his first wife had also had an affair. But Crawford says he didn't say that.The prosecution also called DNA analyst Angela Fletcher who examined swabs taken from Tiffiney's gun. She testified that because there was only a trace amount of DNA detected on the gun, she couldn't say for sure whether there was any female DNA on it. She was certain, though, that both the grip and the trigger contained male DNA. She couldn't confirm whether that male DNA belonged to Jason Crawford. ""The profile was so limited that I was unable to do any type of comparisons,"" Fletcher told ""48 Hours.""With so little DNA detected on the gun, the prosecution argued that Jason Crawford must have wiped the gun and then planted it in Tiffiney's hand. The defense said there was no proof of this. But perhaps the most damaging testimony against Crawford came from the medical examiner Dr. Valerie Green. She told the jury how she believed the gunshot wound to Tiffiney's temple was fired from more than 10 inches away.The defense showed the jury a pre-recorded deposition with the former chief medical examiner of Alabama, Dr. James Lauridson. ""I believe that … Mrs. Crawford shot herself first in the left side of the face and then shot herself in the left side of the head,"" Dr. Lauridson said. He also testified that there was no way to tell how far away the gun was when the shot to Tiffiney's temple was fired because her hair was in the way.The defense also argued that Tiffiney was struggling emotionally and started seeing a counselor just one day before she died. Tiffiney's friends also testified that she had been drinking excessively and that she was upset because the man she'd had an affair with had recently broken up with her.Tiffiney's journal was also entered into evidence and portions of it were read out loud to the jury. In an entry dated on May 2, 2017 – the day she died – she wrote, ""I'm struggling with figuring out what to do with myself.""On the last day of the trial, Jason Crawford took the stand. He told the jury that he loved Tiffiney and denied killing her. Crawford also testified that he called Tiffiney a degrading name on the night she died. ""I was basically talking down to her ... like she wasn't human,"" Crawford told ""48 Hours."" ""I feel sorry … because I feel like maybe that contributed to what pushed her over the edge to do that.""After four days of testimony, the case went to the jury. Megan Brock was one of the jurors. She said that when the jury got into the deliberation room, several jurors, including herself, were on the fence about Jason Crawford's guilt.Megan Brock said the jury deliberated for several hours before they asked to listen to the 911 call again. And that's what Brock said sealed the deal for the group. ""The…operator, she keeps asking [Jason Crawford]…'who shot her?'"" she told ""48 Hours."" And when the 911 operator then questioned Crawford about where the gun was, that's when the jury came to a unanimous decision. ""He clearly said, 'the gun is laying beside her,"" Brock said. ""When in fact, the body cam footage showed her holding the gun, barely, but holding the gun.""Thirty minutes after the jury listened to the 911 call, they went back into the courtroom and delivered their verdict. The jury found Jason Crawford guilty of his wife Tiffiney's murder. ""I just felt like it shouldn't be happening … I was just stunned,"" he told ""48 Hours.""On March 10, 2023, Jason Crawford stood before the judge again as his lawyers plead his innocence. The judge then sentenced Crawford to 99 years in prison. Under Alabama law, he will be eligible for parole in 15 years. Today, Tiffiney's mother Cheryl McGucken wants to make sure that her grandchildren are proud of their mom. And that they never forget who Tiffiney was and what she stood for. ""She was just an angel that came down from heaven for a short time to teach us all…how to love and be kind and giving,"" McGucken said.","48 Hours, Alabama, Shooting Death, Murder",environment news
177,2023-04-02,CBS News,First piloted flight of Boeing's oft-delayed Starliner astronaut ferry ship slips to mid-summer,"CBS News The first piloted flight of Boeing's Starliner astronaut ferry ship is slipping from late April to at least July 21, officials said Wednesday, to allow more time to close out paperwork and to carry out an additional test of the spacecraft's parachute deploy system.Running years behind schedule, the Crew Flight Test, or CFT, mission will carry two veteran astronauts —   Barry ""Butch"" Wilmore and Sunita Williams —  to the International Space Station to verify the ship's readiness to begin regular service ferrying crews to and from the lab complex, alternating with SpaceX's already operational Crew Dragon.NASA Commercial Crew Program manager Steve Stich said there's nothing wrong with Starliner's parachute system and ""when we look across the vehicle, the Starliner spacecraft is in really good shape. ... The Atlas Launch vehicle is ready for flight.""But reviewing the paperwork needed to officially clear the spacecraft for flight, along with the addition of another ground test and fitting the flight into a busy East Coast launch schedule, combined to push the long-awaited mission from spring to the mid-summer timeframe.""When we look at all the different pieces, most of the work will complete in April for the flight,"" Stich said. ""But there's one area that's extending out into the May time frame. And this really has to do with the certification products for the parachute system.""And so, when we were looking at where to head with the (launch) date, trying to thread the needle at the (Space Force) Eastern Range and then the manifest considerations for ISS, we've decided that the best launch attempt is no earlier than July 21.""Boeing and SpaceX were awarded contracts in 2014 to build commercial crew ships that could carry NASA and partner agency astronauts to and from the space station. SpaceX, under an initial $2.6 billion contract, designed a crewed version of its Dragon cargo ship that would ride into orbit atop the company's Falcon 9 rocket.Boeing designed its own capsule —   Starliner —   under a $4.2 billion contract, relying on United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rockets for the trip to orbit.After a successful unpiloted test flight, SpaceX launched a two-man crew to the space station in May 2020. The company has now launched nine piloted Crew Dragon missions, seven for NASA and two privately funded flights, ending the nation's sole reliance on Russian Soyuz spacecraft for access to low-Earth orbit.Boeing had hoped to launch its first crew in 2020 as well, but the company ran into  during an unpiloted test flight in December 2019. After resolving , another test flight .This time around, the Starliner completed its major objectives, robotically docking with the space station as planned. At that point, NASA was aiming for a piloted launch later that year.But additional analysis and reviews pushed the flight into 2023 and, after several more slips, it's now moved out to July, assuming the necessary work can be completed in time and planners resolve a launch date conflict with another Atlas 5 mission.As for the Starliner's parachute system, Stich said ""there are really no issues or concerns. Those parachutes are installed in the vehicle, they're in good shape, it's just a matter of going through all that data and making sure we're really ready to go fly safely.""The additional ground test was added to make sure a protective heat shield at the top of the spacecraft will deploy properly under high-stress abort conditions to enable release of the parachutes needed to slow the vehicle during its descent to landing.""We're going to do a test at the highest possible (stress) regime that they could see in an abort,"" Stich said. ""And so we'll do that test on the ground, just to make sure that system can deploy properly.""Assuming the Crew Flight Test goes well and the Starliner wins NASA certification, the agency plans to launch two commercial crew flights to the space station each year, one using SpaceX's Crew Dragon and the other Boeing's Starliner.With two operational crew ferry ships available, NASA astronauts will have assured access to the space station even if problems ground one of the two spacecraft.""Getting a second crew transportation capability for the space station is hugely important to us,"" Stich said. ""And so we've been working really hard on that.""Bill Harwood has been covering the U.S. space program full-time since 1984, first as Cape Canaveral bureau chief for United Press International and now as a consultant for CBS News.

179,2023-04-02,CBS News,"Meet ""the cow"" – the flattest explosion ever seen in space","CBS News Scientists have found what they're calling ""the cow"" 180 million light years away. But it's not bovine in space – it's a massive explosion that's flatter than the experts ever imagined. Stars pretty much always explode in a spherical shape, but in 2018, scientists observed an unusual star explosion deep in space that was the ""most aspherical ever seen,"" according to a  from the University of Sheffield. Justyn Maund, an astrophysics lecturer at the university, was the lead author of the latest study on the observation, published in .The observation was made after scientists accidentally – and luckily – saw a flash of polarized light in June 2018 that was captured by telescopes in Hawaii. A 2019 news release from , whose researcher Raffaella Margutti was part of the initially reported findings, says the explosion, dubbed AT2018cow, was a ""spectacularly bright anomaly"" 10 to 100 times brighter than supernovas. Scientists also observed that the explosion unleashed particles flying at 10% of the speed of light. ""We knew right away that this source went from inactive to peak luminosity within just a few days,"" Margutti said. ""That was enough to get everybody excited because it was so unusual and, by astronomical standards, it was very close by.""In Maund's study, researchers measured the polarization of that flash, which allowed them to identify the explosion's shape, and through that, they found that it was about the size of Earth's solar system in a galaxy about 180 million light-years away. They determined the explosion was a rare Fast Blue Optical Transient, a kind of explosion that astronomers have come to refer to as ""the cow."" The latest discovery is only the fifth of this type of star explosion to ever be seen. ""Very little is known about FBOT explosions – they just don't behave like exploding stars should, they are too bright and they evolve too quickly,"" Maund said. ""Put simply, they are weird, and this new observation makes them even weirder. ... we never thought that explosions could be this aspherical."" He offered two potential reasons the explosion could have happened in this fashion. The first is that the stars that exploded could have created a disc shape just before they died. The other? The star collapsed into a black hole and ate the rest of its formation, an event known as a failed supernova. ""What we know for sure is that the levels of asymmetry recorded are a key part of understanding these mysterious explosions,"" Maund said, ""and it challenges our preconceptions of how stars might explode in the universe."" Li Cohen is a social media producer and trending content writer for CBS News.","star, Explosion, Science, Space",science news

181,2023-04-02,CBS News,Drug trafficking blamed as homicides soar in Costa Rica,"AP In this colorful Caribbean port, where cruise ship passengers are whisked to jungle adventures in Costa Rica's interior, locals try to be home by dark and police patrol with high-caliber guns in the face of soaring drug violence.Costa Rica logged a record 657 homicides last year and Limon – with a homicide rate five times the national average -- was the epicenter.The bloodshed in a country better known for its laid-back, ""it's all good"" outlook and its lack of a standing army has stirred a public outcry as the administration of President Rodrigo Chaves scrambles for answers.Where Costa Rica had previously been just a pass-through for northbound cocaine from Colombian and Mexican cartels, authorities say it is now a warehousing and transshipment point for drugs sent to Europe by homegrown Costa Rican gangs.In Limon, that shifting criminal dynamic has mixed with swelling ranks of young unemployed men who make up the majority of the casualties in fierce territorial battles.Martín Arias, the deputy security minister and head of Costa Rica's Coast Guard, said Limon's violence stems from disputes over both the control of cocaine shipped to Europe and the marijuana sold locally.In January, authorities dismantled a ring working to smuggle drugs through the container port. Cocaine has been secreted into walls of the steel containers and even packed among pineapple and yucca headed for Spain and Holland.Foreign drug traffickers used to pay Costa Rican fishermen to bring gasoline to their smuggling boats.""Later, the Mexican narcos said, 'We're not going to use money; we're not going to leave the trail that money leaves in banks, in systems; we're going to pay in cocaine,'"" Arias said.At first, the fishermen and their associates didn't have the contacts to sell their cocaine abroad, so they sold it locally as crack. But once they realized how much more the cocaine was worth in Europe, they began smuggling it out of the port, he said.Meanwhile, marijuana was arriving from Jamaica and Colombia, and gangs fought over the local market. Victims of that violence are mostly in marginalized neighborhoods, Arias said.Costa Rican authorities classified 421 of last year's 657 homicides as ""score settling.""Former Security Minister Gustavo Mata estimated that 80% of the killings in Costa Rica were related to the growth in drug trafficking.""We used to talk about Colombian cartels, Mexican cartels,"" Mata said. But now investigators have found gangs led by Costa Ricans, he said.Mata, who served as security minister from 2015 to 2018, said that Costa Rica had become an ""enormous warehouse"" of drugs and an operations center for exports to Europe.The Limon port's shipping business – both legal and illegal – has placed it at the center of violence.""In Limon, there are four strong criminal groups competing for the drug market,"" said Randall Zúñiga, director of Costa Rica's Judicial Investigation Department. These groups clash, and ""generally the people who die are sellers or members of the criminal groups.""But the violence has not been confined to Limon or to those involved in the drug trade.The Feb. 28 shooting of 8-year-old Samuel Arroyo, killed by a stray bullet while he slept in the capital San Jose, stirred popular outrage. Costa Ricans with no connection to the boy's family turned out for his funeral carrying white balloons.President Chaves said Samuel died in a manner that was ""outrageous, inexplicable and unacceptable."" The president said the shooting apparently stemmed from a gang war. A 15-year-old was arrested in connection with the death.One month earlier, Ingrid Muñoz organized a demonstration outside federal courts in San Jose to demand action after her 19-year-old son Keylor Gambia was killed defending his girlfriend from an assault.""What we're seeking is to create consciousness so that there is not impunity,"" Muñoz said. ""What we want is justice, so that the judges, as well as the prosecutors, understand the serious situation that not only the youth, but everyone in the country, is living.""Security Minister Jorge Torres, in comments to congress in January, faulted a justice system in which he said those sentenced on drug violations serve only a fraction of their prison sentences. ""There are crimes for which you must serve the entire sentence,"" Torres said.Torres said he would have a new security strategy ready by June, but meanwhile more resources for police were needed. ""If we want to resolve this in the short term we need more police in the streets,"" he said.Limon sits 100 miles (160 kilometers) east of San Jose. It is Costa Rica's most important port, handling much of the country's exports to the United States and Europe.In 2018, the government privatized its container port, giving the concession to a Dutch company.Antonio Wells, secretary general of the dockworkers union for Costa Rica's Atlantic ports, said some 7,000 jobs were lost in the port privatization, which he blames for Limon's social problems.Last year, Limon was the canton with the second-highest murder rate with more than 62 homicides per 100,000 residents.""If there are no jobs, it sounds terrible to say, but for many the closest thing to a job is being a hit man,"" Wells said.Costa Rica's murder rate has increased in each of the last four years. Last year's rate was 12.6 per 100,000 residents, still only about one-third of Honduras, but the highest for Costa Rica since at least 1990.Costa Rica's Association of Professionals in Economic Sciences in January found a strong correlation between low levels of development and high homicide rates in the most violent cantons like Limon.""This isn't the Limon I grew up in,"" a retiree who identified himself only as David said on a recent day as he chatted with others in the city's central square. ""After 9 o'clock at night you can't walk and it's really sad.""","Mexico, costa rica, Cartel, Crime",france news
182,2023-04-02,CBS News,Chowchilla bus kidnapping: Rare photos from one of the largest abductions in U.S. history,"CBS NEWS A look inside the truck trailer where 26 abducted school children and their bus driver were buried alive -- and managed to escape. On July 15, 1976, 26 school children and their bus driver from , California, were in this tractor trailer. The frightening ordeal began when the children, ages 5-14, were on a school bus on their way home from summer school. At around 4 p.m., on July 16, 1976, three masked men with guns hijacked the Dairyland Elementary School bus driven by Ed Ray. The kidnappers then drove the bus into a dry riverbed and hid it in tree brush.The stunned children were herded from the bus into two vans. They were forced to jump from the bus to the vans so that they would not leave behind any footprints.Jennifer Brown Hyde, who was 9 at the time of the kidnapping, remembers what it felt like inside the van. ""And I felt like I was an animal going to the slaughterhouse."" Inside the vans, the kidnappers had constructed makeshift jail cells by installing wood paneling and painting the windows. No one could see in or out. There was no air ventilation, food, water or toilets.Jodi Heffington, who was 10 at the time, remembered the moments before she got into the second van.""He held a shot gun to my stomach. … And I had to stand there with this gun in my gut until that one van drove away and they backed the second van up. It felt like forever. I thought he was going to shoot me ... I actually did,"" Jodi told ""48 Hours.""The kidnappers drove around for nearly 12 hours as the children suffered inside the sweltering, pitch-black vans. Finally, the vans stopped. The kidnappers had taken them to a rock quarry, 100 miles away from Chowchilla in Livermore, California. Bus driver Ed Ray and the children were taken out of the van, one by one, and sent down into a hole. They soon learned they were inside an old truck trailer and they had been buried 12 feet underground.  The kidnappers had made toilets in the wheel wells of the tractor trailer. Inside the hole, the children found containers filled with water for them to drink. They also found boxes of cereal, peanut butter and loaves of bread.  Two ventilation pipes provided air to the children who were trapped 12 feet underground. The children tried to stay calm as the minutes and hours ticked by. After being in the hole for almost 12 hours, conditions started to deteriorate. The roof started to cave in, and they were running out of food.Survivor Jennifer Brown Hyde said, ""It was just a desperate situation … We thought … if we're going to die, were going to die trying to get out of here.""  Ed Ray and the kids decided they had to try and to escape before it was too late. Bus driver Ed Ray and Michael Marshall, 14, took turns pushing up on the heavy manhole cover that was blocking the opening to the hole. Once they were able to move that, Michael started the arduous task of digging to the top.  After many grueling hours, Michael Marshall dug himself to the top. It had been 28 hours of terror. Ed Ray and the children walked toward the rock quarry and were greeted by stunned workers. Soon police arrived                  and photos, like these, were taken of each child as evidence.Police took school bus driver Ed Ray and the children to the closest place that could hold them all -- the Santa Rita Rehabilitation Center, a local jail. Pictured at center is Jennifer Brown. At the Santa Rita Rehabilitation Center, the children were given apples and soda, and examined by doctors. Ed Ray and the children were interviewed by police.The children waited patiently, but they all just wanted to get home to their families. Finally, approximately four hours after escaping, the children boarded yet another bus … ... this time the bus was heading back home to Chowchilla. The children could not wait to be reunited with their families.Parents and families of the returning school children waited anxiously for the arrival of their children inside the Chowchilla police station on July 17, 1976.When 6-year-old survivor Larry Park arrived home to his parents he said, ""I finally felt safe again."" Park is pictured in the arms of his father. Immediately, police started to dig for clues at the scene of the crime. Investigators unearthed the truck trailer that had been the children's underground tomb hoping they would find clues that would lead them to the kidnappers. Media from all over the world covered the story. It would take almost two weeks to track the kidnappers, but investigators finally arrested 24-year-old Frederick Newhall Woods, the son of the owner of the rock quarry where the kids were held. They also arrested his partner in a used car business, 24-year-old James Schoenfeld, center, and James' younger brother Richard. All came from wealthy families who lived in San Francisco's nicest suburbs. Security guards had seen the three men digging in the quarry months before the kidnapping. When investigators executed a warrant to search the estate of Fred Woods' father, they found a treasure trove of evidence. One important piece was this document that says, ""plan."" It sets out how the kidnappers were going to commit the crime and what they would do if something went wrong. Another important piece of evidence was this draft of a ransom note. The draft of the note says the kidnappers wanted $2.5 million, but their final plan was to ask for $5 million. They were never able to deliver their demand because when they tried to call, the phone lines were jammed. Another piece of important evidence was this list of the kidnapped children's names written on the back of a Jack in the Box wrapper. The kidnappers wrote them down as they pulled each child from the van. When later tested by investigators, they found fingerprints from two of the three kidnappers. The kidnappers were all eventually sentenced to life with the possibility of parole.There were more than 60 parole hearings total for the three kidnappers. Thirty-six years after the kidnapping, Richard Schoenfeld was granted parole in June 2012. Three years later, his brother James was paroled.Jodi Heffington, who went to almost all of the parole hearings, is pictured at Fred Woods 15th parole hearing in 2018., the last kidnapper in prison, was  on August 17, 2022 after 17 previous denials.                  Jennifer Brown Hyde is a wife, mother and executive assistant.  Until just recently, she could not sleep without a night-light.Michael Marshall is a father and long-distance trucker. He has a therapy dog, Blue. He says, ""I rescued him before he was a year old. And now he rescues me every day.""Larry Park owns a handyman business and volunteers as a pastor at a local church. He says he has forgiven the kidnappers. Jodi Heffington stayed in Chowchilla where she opened a hair salon and raised a son. She said the kidnapping affected her throughout her life.""I think it made me not a good daughter, not a good sister, not a good aunt and especially not a good mother.  And probably not a good friend. … I try to be those things, but it seems like it, it just took something from me that I can't ever get back, she told ""48 Hours.""

We test and trial things for months leading up, and ultimately, we rely on our partner Cisco to ensure that we have the best playbook in the business,"" Maldonado explained.He went on to say it took ""more preparation, building off of our success last year, tightening up our security protocols, and making sure that we had the best technology and talent [to pull it off]."" But it's not just about preparation.Cisco Cybersecurity Distinguished Engineer Mike Storm described the company's approach for the Super Bowl as being similar to a football coach's approach to a big game. He said that Cisco uses the most up-to-date monitoring and threat data to ensure they know what the environment will look like leading up to and on game day.""We walk into every project with a game plan. Many of the skills we bring are the same ones needed to play on the field,"" Storm said. He compared Cisco's maneuvers to those of a quarterback, constantly maximizing visibility and assessing threats close by and farther afield.""When that blitzing linebacker comes through, it's the running back's responsibility to execute a block to protect the quarterback as he goes through his progressions,"" Storm told Hall. ""Cisco uses its security technology to give the NFL maximum visibility into its network and multiple layers of defense to ensure it can take the right action to complete the game plan and ultimately succeed. With the stakes being so high, we can't afford to fail. So we won't.""And it paid off! According to Cisco, a massive amount of traffic was managed flawlessly across the network, with nearly 17,000 security intelligence events blocked and more than 400,000 connections blocked to and from blacklisted areas of the world.""We received millions of queries, with thousands blocked or investigated, and every potential attack was denied,"" Storm said. The work doesn't stop there. Maldonado says the NFL is becoming a global league, which means it will need to be more connected and protected than ever before. ""There is no offseason. We're already preparing and looking ahead to the Draft,"" Maldonado said. ""The fans are demanding to be even further engaged and be a part of the experience. This means there are more devices and more data requiring instant visibility.""This is why when the game plan calls for the best protection, the NFL relies on Cisco.",Sports,science news
184,2023-04-02,CBS News,"Country music and corn: Inside the new musical comedy ""Shucked""","CBS News Who says you can't do a show with country music on Broadway? You probably know every word of ""Oklahoma!"" The Mark Twain musical ""Big River"" won seven Tonys. And ""Annie Get Your Gun"" was a big ol' hit, especially the countrified revival with Reba McEntire. And now, a brand-new country-themed musical about corn is ready to pop.""Shucked,"" which opens Tuesday, is that rarest of birds on Broadway: a completely original production not based on a movie or, really, anything else. It's the story of a small town closed off from society by cornfields. But when the corn starts suddenly dying, one brave soul goes to the big city for help, and a musical happens. The show started out as a nod to the old TV program ""Hee Haw,"" but after more than ten years and a few complete overhauls, it's ready to stand on its own.   Caroline Innerbichler, who plays the heroine Maizy, said a Broadway show with country music makes perfect sense: ""Because country music, I've always felt, is the closest thing, other than Broadway, to Broadway, 'cause it's all about storytelling.""Alex Newell, who plays Maizy's cousin, Lulu, said the genre is a first for her: ""I've done dance music, I've done Broadway, I've done jazz standards. I've done everything under the umbrella  country music.""It helps that the duo behind the music has some pretty impressive credentials. Brandy Clark, who herself grew up in a small town in Washington State, has written hits for the biggest stars in country, and has an album she made with Brandi Carlisle coming out soon. Her writing partner on ""Shucked"" is Shane McAnally, also one of the biggest songwriters in Music City. He's got three Grammys and a slew of other awards, but one of the things he says he cherishes the most is working with Brandy Clark.They clicked from the moment they met many, many hit songs ago: ""It was like lightning struck,"" McAnally said. Their music is key, but the sound you hear most often at a ""Shucked"" performance is laughter. A lot of the jokes are pretty edgy, and it's easy to see why: the book writer, Robert Horn, used to write for the hit show ""Designing Women.""Smith asked, ""You can kind of sense that there's a little 'Designing Women' in this?""""There's a little 'Designing Women' in all of us, you have to say!"" Horn laughed. Back then, his comedy formula was simple: ""I used to say, 'I'm gonna write it Jewish, and you're gonna say it Southern.' That was the joke,"" he said. ""And it did work, yes.""For composers Clark and McAnally, it's the end of a long and emotional road, watching the show come to life: ""We sit together every night through these previews,"" McAnally said. ""Alex Newell sings a song called 'Independently Owned' in the middle of the first act, and received a standing ovation in the middle of the act. I'm a former addict. I have tried everything that I like many times over. And I just looked at [Brandy] and said, 'This is like no high I have ever experienced.'""Clark said, ""A couple of nights ago, I just had this overwhelming feeling. I was looking at the barn, and Shane and I were sitting there, and I was like, 'This is so weird for me to say this to you right now, but I just love you so much.' Because that is how I feel when we're sitting there. Like, even though we're not a couple, it is like we have this child.""And the hope is that their child will be something Broadway, and the rest of us, could probably use right about now: a freewheeling, knee-slapping bundle of joy.Alex Newell said, ""There are a lot of heavy shows. And we need heavy shows. We love, we thrive off of heavy shows. But sometimes you just need to do a little laughing. Sometimes you just need to let that go and have a guffaw. We've been inside for so long and we forgot that joy can exist.""",Broadway,france news

188,2023-04-02,CBS News,Pendleton blankets: A thread to the past,"CBS News A mill in Eastern Oregon that has been weaving wool for more than a century is, quite literally, part of the fabric of the community. The town's name – Pendleton – is stitched into every product. The company was started in the early 1900s by the Bishop brothers, who came to town to try their hand at the blanket business. Their blankets' patterns were designed to appeal to Pendleton's first customers: Native Americans. ""The first recorded interaction in our homeland with Euro Americans was Lewis and Clark in 1805,"" said Bobbie Conner, director of the Tamástslikt Cultural Institute, located on the Umatilla Indian Reservation just outside Pendleton. ""We came to know a few other explorers who came in their wake. And then, the Hudson's Bay Company set up a trading post in our homeland in 1816. That's where our love of wool was born.""Those early companies exchanged what became known as ""trade blankets."" ""If you've ever worn a wet leather jacket, you know the difference between the weight of that and the weight of a wool coat,"" said Connor. ""Wool was durable.""But it was more than a functional fabric. Native Americans began using prized Pendleton blankets to mark special occasions – births, weddings, funerals. It's a tradition that continues to this day. And whenever a blanket began to show its age, it's given new life. Connor said, ""We have been repurposing Pendleton wool forever. My aunt, when I was in college, cut up and made Pendleton wool pillows as sort of keepsakes from home.""Of course, part of the reason the blankets originally appealed to Native Americans was that they featured the types of geometric designs that were already common in indigenous art. Knighton asked, ""Something that might have once been presented as 'borrowing,' today is talked about in terms of appropriation. Do you see it as appropriation?""Connor replied, ""The idea that I might come and take a picture of something prized and handmade that you wear and turn that into a design without acknowledging the maker, without having a relationship with the person who created it, and then taking that and turn that into a retail product, we would consider disrespectful.""The respectful thing to do is to talk to me and talk about that relationship and what that might be, and that's, I think, what Pendleton in its most recent decades has become: a purveyor of goods that are created out of relationships with tribal people,"" she said. Today, Pendleton has added designs made by contemporary Native American artists, and has a series of items that has raised over a million dollars for the American Indian College Fund. The business has also expanded far beyond blankets. Pendleton started making apparel in the 1920s, but it wasn't until the 1960s when one of its plaid shirts really took off, thanks to its unexpected popularity with some Southern California surfers, who used wool to keep warm at the beach. Pendleton's plaid shirts even appeared on the cover of the Beach Boys album, ""Surfin' Safari.""After Jeff Bridges wore a Pendleton sweater in ""The Big Lebowski,"" the ""Dude sweater"" is today one of the company's top sellers. [Like most of Pendleton's apparel, it's manufactured overseas.] But the bulk of the blanket business remains in the Pacific Northwest, where some patterns are still created with punch card looms that are decades old.In fact, Pendleton's woolen mills are some of the only ones left, in a country that once had thousands. Pendleton CEO John Bishop, the fifth generation of his family to be involved in the textile industry, said Pendleton has survived because it has a brand that sells directly to consumers. ""In the early '80s, there were roughly 25 mills in the U.S., and now there's three of us,"" he said. ""All of those mills, you know, they sold to apparel manufacturers. And the apparel manufacturers, they're still in business because they moved offshore.""Still, that American-made product is pricey; a king-size blanket can go for $500. Bob Christnact, executive vice president of sales and marketing for Pendleton Woolen Mills, said it's the legacy behind the patterns that makes their products unique. Knight asked Christnact, ""If you're looking for a blanket, you can find something at a big box store for $20. Why is someone spending hundreds of dollars for a Pendleton?""""That cheap blanket in a big box store might be around for a few years, and then it's going to be gone,"" he replied. ""We're creating legacy products that are going to last generations."" A blanket given to mark a graduation, a marriage, or a death is a way to tell story. Each one provides a thread to the past. For Bobbie Conner, they're a way to connect with family: ""I have a Pendleton blanket for each of my uncles who's passed away that was given to me, either by the uncle during my lifetime, or given to me by his family when he passed away. It's the treasures of your life that represent the people who are important to you.""",Native Americans,politics news

194,2023-04-02,CBS News,"Transcript: Preet Bharara on ""Face the Nation,"" April 2, 2023","CBS News MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face The Nation. Joining us now is the former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Preet Bharara. Good morning. PREET BHARARA: Morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: I do want to mention to our viewers as well, that you obviously know New York very well. But you also know, the district attorney, Alvin Bragg. BHARARA: I do. MARGARET BRENNAN: You hired him at one point. BHARARA: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: You endorsed him when he ran for this office. BHARARA: I did and I supervised him for a while as well. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. So, I want to dig into your knowledge of that man, who is now very much in the spotlight. But let me start first on the case itself. The previous District Attorney of Manhattan didn't prosecute this case, your former office, the Southern District of New York, also chose at the federal level not to move ahead with it. So what do you think is different this time?BHARARA: We don't know. I know the man pretty well. Alvin Bragg, as you said, Excuse me. I don't know what the charges are. We've been speculating about them. Maybe there's new evidence, different people who are reasonable, like Cy Vance is and like Alvin Bragg is, can come to different conclusions about different matters. You know, there were two prosecutors in Alvin Bragg's office, who resigned with great fanfare over a different set of charges that might have been brought against Donald Trump. And there was a difference of opinion about that. Alvin Bragg is a careful person based on my experience with him, a deliberate person, not an overtly political person. And he decided based on things that we don't know about yet, because we haven't seen the indictment, or any evidence at trial, that it was a worthwhile case to bring. I can't, you know, speculate as to why Cy Vance didn't bring the case, or why my former office didn't bring the case. Although, there are some reasons to think maybe it was because they were concerned that Michael Cohen had not been fully forthcoming, and they have a policy of not putting on witnesses, as cooperating witnesses, if they haven't divulged everything about themselves and everyone else, that was a policy that was in place when I was the U.S. Attorney. So different policies, different legal considerations may be the reason why there's a divergence, but we don't know for sure.MARGARET BRENNAN: So one of the things that CBS News has confirmed here is that the former president is being charged with falsifying business records in the first degree, which is that class E felony? BHARARA: Yeah.MARGARET BRENNAN: If I understand it correctly, and that would require them to prove, in other words have evidence here, that it's more than the misdemeanor of falsifying records, that it was done to hide a second crime. That seems fairly complex, what kind of evidence do you need to have there?BHARARA: So it's not that complex, it's done all the time. So the predicate offense, falsification of business records, is pretty simple. It seems to have been conceded in large part by various people, including some of the President's own lawyers, that on the business records of the company, it has been suggested that the payments made to Stormy Daniels and other payments were legal fees when they obviously weren't. Michael Cohen was a pass through for, you know, one hundred plus thousand dollars to someone else. And then the other crime, we believe to be campaign finance violation.MARGARET BRENNAN: But, that part is fairly novel here. In fact, the former Manhattan district attorney, Cy Vance, was on another network this morning, making that point he said, 'we've historically filed cases of false documentation to a felony level when federal statutes were involved, but has never- this has never been done with regard to federal election law.' So would the Alvin Bragg you know, who you said doesn't really take a lot of risks here and is not political, would he take this risk?BHARARA: Well, he's probably done legal analysis and his people have told him that you can have a federal crime be the thing that's being concealed or being furthered by the falsification crime. And just because it's never been a campaign finance violation before, I'm sure his people have told him and have research to back this up, that there's no distinction between one kind of federal violation or another. So it is true that that's not been tested in court and there's gonna be legal challenges here. I don't think anybody thinks and I haven't heard anybody say, even though we haven't seen the charges yet, it's a slam dunk, 100 percent winner. But, I believe based on the Alvin Bragg that I know who was careful and was so careful as not to bring that other case that people were clamoring for him to bring, that he has sound legal ground to bring this one.MARGARET BRENNAN: The former Trump Attorney General Bill Barr spoke about the indictment in interview Friday. I want to hear what he had to say.BARR SOT: It's the archetypal abuse of the prosecutorial function to engage in a political hit job and legally, I think it's- it's from what I understand it's- it's a pathetically weak case.MARGARET BRENNAN: You just told us that Alvin Bragg is not overtly political. That's the exact opposite impression from the former Attorney General.BHARARA: Well, there are a lot of people who think the former Attorney General was overtly political and weaponized the Justice Department. So it's- it's a little bit rich to hear him calling someone else political.MARGARET BRENNAN: But on the grounds that he says 'pathetically weak' case. BHARARA: Yeah, well, we don't know that. MARGARET BRENNAN: You're saying until these charges are unsealed Tuesday, no one can speak with authority.BHARARA: I feel I've been talking about the case because I think we have some credible reporting and I think we have, you know, good sources who are telling us what the case might be about and we have Michael Cohen talking about it. It does feel a little funny given my prior job, to be openly speculating about the strength of the case before we've seen what the charges are. And by the way, even when we see the charges, we won't necessarily know what all the evidentiary basis for those charges are. I believe it'll be a speaking indictment, which is parlance for lots of- more detail than you sometimes need to have an indictment. But we don't know the quality of the evidence. We can speculate about the credibility issues that Michael Cohen has, but beyond that, you know, we know some of the documents, we know some of the checks that are signed in Donald Trump's own name to reimburse Michael Cohen for the hush money payment, 11 checks in all, that continued, by the way, into Donald Trump's term as president when he was sitting in the Oval Office. But we don't all have all the evidence. And what's interesting to me is when people attack Alvin Bragg ahead of time, for being political, and being weak, they are themselves doing the exact same thing, defending someone who is their political ally.MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to talk about some of that later on with another guests on the show on the politics of this, but because you know, Alvin Bragg, and this is the- I mean, Republicans aren't unified on a lot of things these days, but the unified Republican defense of Trump is not to talk at all about the case being built against him, but rather to attack Bragg himself. How would you characterize him in terms of policy? He ran as a Democrat to this office, is- does he have higher political ambitions? SoBHARARA: I don't know that he does. When I said he's not overtly political. Obviously, every district attorney in almost every jurisdiction in the country, with the exception of a few is a political office, you run for office. The Alvin Bragg that I know has always thought about the facts and the law. And I keep going back to this point, if he was so overtly political, and didn't mind bringing pathetically weak cases, and he was on a witch hunt to get Donald Trump, by whatever means possible and as soon as possible, he would have brought this other case that very well respected prosecutors in his office were adamantly urging him to bring, and he didn't. To me that indicates and look, this case may fail, it may not go well, maybe it'll be dismissed. I don't think so because I think the law is probably on Alvin Bragg's side, but we'll see. Maybe he'll lose at trial, but the idea that this is frivolous, when someone who has gone to prison, who's less culpable and gone to prison at the direction of the person we're talking about now, Donald Trump, the idea that this is frivolous, or purely political, or stupid or anything else is nonsensical.MARGARET BRENNAN: Because falsifying business records on its face, whether it's a misdemeanor or a felony is still a crime.BHARARA: Yeah, there should be one standard of justice, right? And if there's a crime that's being brought, that's being charged against people in New York City, on a regular basis, and in particular, has been charged in this kind of context, than to say that someone because he was the former President of the United States should get away with it doesn't seem right. I understand the concerns, the potential democratic concerns, I'm not giving them short shrift, that if you're going to charge a former president in an unprecedented way, you want to be careful. You want to have your T's crossed, your I's dotted, you want to do it not in a casual way. You want to be very, very serious about it, and explain in the documents that you file in court and in the indictment, that this is serious, and someone else has gone to prison for this. And I get that we don't want to be in a position where we're incentivizing local prosecutors to do this kind of thing, but on the other hand, it is not frivolous. It is not silly.MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Preet Bharara, thank you for your insights today. We'll be right back.",Preet Bharara,england news
195,2023-04-02,CBS News,"Michael Cohen on the Trump indictment: ""I expect complete and total mayhem""","CBS News Former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen will, along with all of us, see something surreal this week: a former President of the United States arriving at Manhattan Criminal Courthouse to take a mug shot and be fingerprinted, all as protestors gather outside. ""I expect complete and total mayhem,"" said Cohen.""This is his worst fear: being mugshotted, fingerprinted, being referred to as a felon,"" he said. Costa asked, ""Trump keeps projecting confidence, but you sense fear?"" ""Oh, yes. Not fear; he's .""During Trump's 2016 campaign, Cohen made hush-money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels to keep Daniels from going public about an alleged affair with Trump. Seven years later, the alleged falsified records of those payments, and Trump's role, are at the center of Trump's indictment. Cohen, who has  for Trump-related crimes (including the payments to Daniels), is the key witness in the case that has sparked a firestorm.Costa asked, ""If you met someone in an elevator and they said, 'Hey, Michael, I'm not sure I should take your word on all of this, because Republicans have attacked your credibility,' what would you tell them?""""I'm not asking you to take me for my credibility,"" he replied. ""Let the documents and the evidence speak for itself."" Trump has been busy speaking for himself as he once again runs for president. ""Our opponents have done everything they can to crush our spirit, and to break our will,"" he said at a campaign rally in Waco, Texas March 25. ""But they failed. They've only made us stronger."" Trump's lawyer in the New York case, Joe Tacopina, tells CBS News that his client has done nothing wrong, and sharply criticized Cohen's credibility. For CBS News legal analyst Rikki Klieman, it's not so much the crime, but the coverup of the crime. She said the Manhattan District Attorney will likely focus on how Trump handled the expensing of the payments. But she does not believe it'll be an open-and-shut case. ""The district attorney, Alvin Bragg, has a very tough road ahead,"" she said. ""Where Alvin Bragg has issues is going to be with the court. You're going to have a judge who's going to have to rule on the legality of this case going forward. This is not going to be a simple case.""And don't forget, she said, this is just one of several ongoing investigations of the former president, including a special counsel probe of Trump's conduct around January 6.""Donald Trump has some very serious legal challenges, far more serious than the one in New York, where you're dealing with crimes against the United States of America,"" Klieman said. ""That's very different than a scheme involving business records within the Trump Organization. Those are serious crimes.""This crossroads is a reckoning not only for Trump, but for Republicans. Many of them, even those who have had some differences with him, have rallied to his side, including former Vice President Mike Pence, who said, ""I think it's clear to the overwhelming majority of the American people that this is nothing short of a political prosecution.""Costa asked Cohen, ""Why do you think Republicans, at least many of them, keep staying with Trump?""""They're in the cult,"" Cohen replied. ""And I know what it's like to be in the cult. ""It's time to wash your eyes and to see exactly who Donald Trump is,"" he said. ""It's time to start to listen to the truth. See, that's the problem: Donald Trump doesn't tell the truth, ever. Ever. Everything that he says is either a mis-exaggeration, misinformation, disinformation, malinformation, or just a blatant lie. And that information is all done in order to benefit one person, and one person only, and that's him.""Robert Costa is CBS News' chief election and campaign correspondent based in Washington, D.C.","Michael Cohen, Donald Trump, Stormy Daniels, Indictment",politics news

199,2023-04-02,CBS News,"Transcript: John Bolton on ""Face the Nation,"" April 2, 2023","CBS News MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to John Bolton, who served as national security adviser under former President Trump. Good to have you here. AMBASSADOR JOHN BOLTON: Glad to be back.MARGARET BRENNAN: So as we were just discussing, Republicans seemed to be avoiding explicitly defending Mr. Trump's actions and instead attacking the district attorney of Manhattan. But we don't know the details of these charges. We won't until Tuesday. If- if then don't you see there being a danger for Republicans to do that because they are still aligning themselves with the former president, who I know you are sharply critical of?AMB. BOLTON: Yeah, I think it's a big mistake politically for Republicans to do that. And I think it's important to stress that in this case that involves hush- hush money to a porn star to cover up an affair that later involves cooking his company's books, you have not heard a single Trump defender stand up and say, oh, that's not the Donald Trump I know. And it goes to the question of character and fitness for the presidency. I think that Trump's obviously trying to attack the prosecutor and his supporters are following that. Look, prosecutors have broad discretion and they should, but they don't have unlimited discretion. If Trump thinks there's prosecutorial misconduct here, violating the laws, violating the prosecutor or lawyer's ethical obligations, he has plenty of opportunities to raise that. But if he can't show that Alvin Bragg has violated the law or violated the ethics rules that are applicable, then he's got to run his own chances. And to my mind, there is a kind of rough justice here, because it's deeply ironic that a person who spent a good part of his four years in the White House trying to weaponize the Justice Department against his political enemies is now saying he's the victim of persecution. It's sort of what comes around goes around, Mr. Trump.MARGARET BRENNAN: So you agree that the Justice Department was weaponized under the Trump administration?JOHN BOLTON: I can attest to it personally. I don't need to look at other stories.MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you mean by that?JOHN BOLTON: Well, when Trump and his lawyers in the White House and in the Justice Department brought both a civil and a criminal case against me--MARGARET BRENNAN: For your book. AMB. BOLTON: --for publishing a book that didn't go through the prepublication review process, when they know that it had been cleared in the regular order that- that is abusing the Justice Department. And there are plenty of other examples besides. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you brought up your book. In it, you talk about President Trump being obsessed with media coverage of his former attorney, Michael Cohen, who's now very much at the heart of this trial case, who was on trial himself. And you said it was a big distraction in the midst of the trip to Hanoi where the former president was negotiating with Kim Jong Un. I mean, nuclear security. But he was obsessed with the Cohen case. Do you look at that differently now? Do you think there was a real reason for him to be worried or was it just a PR concern?AMB. BOLTON: Well, I think- I think he does have reason to be concerned about the substance of the case here. And I think while we're all obviously and appropriately focused on the indictment, that's just the beginning. The real issue here is whether Alvin Bragg gets a conviction--MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. AMB. BOLTON:  --at some point in the near term or whether Trump springs free because the political implications are vastly different.MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I mean, the timetable for this goes right into 2024. And we don't have clarity on that. AMB. BOLTON: Well, we'll see whether Trump runs the courtroom or whether the judge runs the courtroom.MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you mean?AMB. BOLTON: Well, I have no doubt a lot of trees are going to die to support the motions--MARGARET BRENNAN: Delay. Delay. AMB. BOLTON: --to dismiss the case that Trump's going to file. So if the judge keeps the pace going, you know, people talk about the importance of speedy trial. Let's see if we can get one here.MARGARET BRENNAN: So you said it was a mistake for Republicans in messaging around this, but even Florida's governor, Ron DeSantis, who I know in the past you said good things about, came out and said, oh it's a misdemeanor. Oh, this is political. A misdemeanor's still a crime. But I mean, the only Republican of prominence that has really remained silent, that I've noticed is Mitch McConnell. Most everyone's defending in some way.AMB. BOLTON: Well I think- I think Asa Hutchinson said earlier today--MARGARET BRENNAN: That's true. AMB. BOLTON: In addition to announcing he's running for the- for the presidency, that Trump should stand aside--MARGARET BRENNAN: That's true. AMB. BOLTON: And I think that's an absolute minimum. Look, Trump is basically extorting-- MARGARET BRENNAN: That's two, plus you, that's three.AMB. BOLTON: That- Trump is basically extorting the Republican Party. He's threatening that if he doesn't get the nomination, he'll blow up the presidential campaign, and whoever the Democrats nominate will win. MARGARET BRENNAN: And it seems to be persuasive. AMB. BOLTON: Well, I think what Republicans need to do to save the party and frankly, to save the country, is they can be as concerned about poor Donald Trump being mistreated by this prosecutor as they want. But they- the reward, the cure for that mistreatment is not to make Donald Trump the Republican presidential nominee. Those are two completely different subjects.MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand your point. You have said in the past, if this indictment happens, it's rocket fuel to his campaign to get the Republican nomination for the president. And you think that's what Democrats want, essentially, because it benefits whoever the Democratic nominee is, presumably the current president.AMB. BOLTON: I'm not worried about Alvin Bragg hurting Donald Trump. I'm worried about Alvin Bragg benefiting Donald Trump. And this is where I think the outcome of the case is so important. If Trump is acquitted or he gets the case dismissed because it's not legally sufficient or for whatever reason, that will be rocket fuel, because he can say, I told you it was a political prosecution, I told you I was being picked on, and now I've been vindicated. If he's convicted, however, at some point before the campaign ends, I think that will have a very different impact on people. You can- you can say it's a sleazy case and it  involves sleazy people. But if he's convicted of a crime, I think most Americans actually don't want a convicted felon to be their president.MARGARET BRENNAN: So if he does end up being the nominee, will you support him as the Republican nominee?AMB. BOLTON: Absolutely not. I didn't support him in 2020. I wanted to vote for a real conservative. And neither- there was neither the Republican nor the Democratic nominee were real conservative. So I wrote in a name and I would do the same.MARGARET BRENNAN: So you have said you might be considering a run. Have you ruled that out or are you still considering?AMB. BOLTON: No, I'm still considering it. I have to say, watching the response to the indictment has not been encouraging for the future of the party. Trump is a cancer on the Republican Party. We need his supporters. That's absolutely true. Most of them have correct values. The distortion is--MARGARET BRENNAN: Does it disappoint you-- AMB. BOLTON: --the magnetic field of Donald Trump. MARGARET BRENNNAN: Well, does it disappoint you that someone you have in the past said good things about Ron DeSantis is part part of the group circling the wagons around Mr. Trump?AMB. BOLTON: Well, I believe in redemption for everybody. So I think there's still a way ahead here. But I tell you what, what the- what the people really want in the nominee, I think, is somebody who will say this conduct is unacceptable to us. And we have higher values. We have higher principles than simply defending whatever Donald Trump does.MARGARET BRENNNAN: So you're willing to forgive that of DeSantis. You also, however, have to be upset with his foreign policy positions. He said, well, the US has many vital national interests, becoming further entangled in a territorial dispute between Ukraine and Russia is not one of them. He tried to soften that a little bit afterwards, but it reveals kind of this thread we've seen reflected in some House Republicans of more of an isolationist, or at least, less likely to be as muscular.AMB. BOLTON: Well, as I said before, I was disappointed that Ron DeSantis said that. I'm hoping that his view is changing. But I think this isolationism, I attribute a large part of it to Donald Trump. Not that he has any coherent philosophy, but his knee jerk reaction drives people to take positions that I think they otherwise wouldn't take. I think you go back to a Reaganite foreign policy and a Reaganite optimism that it's morning in America. In fact, it's always morning in America. It's not Donald Trump's version. It's Ronald Reagan's that will get people's support.MARGARET BRENNNAN: John Bolton, thank you for your time today. Thank you. Back in a moment.",Preet Bharara,england news

Participants carried palm fronds or olive tree branches.Francis, 86, received antibiotics administered intravenously during his three-day stay. He last previous appearance in St. Peter's Square saw him conduct his his regular Wednesday public audience. He was taken to Rome's Gemelli Polyclinic that same day after feeling ill.His voice sounded strong as he opened the Mass, but quickly turned strained. Despite the hoarseness, Francis read a 15-minute-long homily, occasionally adding off-the-cuff remarks for emphasis or gesturing with a hand.The homily focused on moments when people feel ""extreme pain, love that fails, or is rejected or betrayed.″ Francis cited ""children who are rejected or aborted,"" as well as broken marriages, ""forms of social exclusion, injustice and oppression, (and) the solitude of sickness.""Deviating from his prepared speech, Francis spoke about a homeless German man who recently died, ""alone, abandoned,"" under the colonnade circling St. Peter's Square, where homeless persons often sleep.""I, too, need Jesus to caress me and be near to me,″ Francis said.Concern over abandonment threaded through his homily. ""Entire peoples are exploited and abandoned; the poor live on our streets and we look the other way; migrants are no longer faces but numbers; prisoners are disowned, people written off as problems,"" Francis said.The pope also referred to ""young people who feel a great emptiness inside without anyone really listening to their cry of pain,"" and who ""find no other path but that of suicide.""Palm Sunday marks Jesus' triumphant entrance into Jerusalem in the time leading up to his crucifixion, which Christians observe on Good Friday.At the end of Mass, Francis greeted the Romans, tourists and pilgrims who had flocked to the square, noting that many in the crowd of 60,000 had come from afar.""I thank you for your participation and prayers, that in the last days you intensified,″ the pontiff said, a reference to the many wishes he received for a quick recovery during his hospitalization. ""Thanks!""Francis' appearance on Sunday opened a heavy schedule of Holy Week appointments, including a Holy Thursday Mass at a juvenile prison in Rome. Holy Week culminates on April 9 with Easter Sunday Mass, which recalls the Christian belief in Jesus' resurrection.Francis said Holy Week will see ""more intense prayer"" for the ""martyred Ukrainian people.″ In a reference , he noted that the olive branches Catholics wave on Palm Sunday are symbols of Jesus' peace.Then, the cardinals greeted Francis greeted one by one, some shaking his hand or chatting briefly with him as he sat in the wheelchair he uses to cope with a chronic knee problem. At least one prelate gave him a kiss on each cheek.Finally, Francis went back aboard the open-topped popemobile to loop around and through the square, as he smiled and waved to the faithful, many of whom held aloft national flags. At one point during the nearly 20-minute jaunt over the cobblestones, he was driven down a stretch of the boulevard lined with cafes and souvenir shops that leads to St. Peter's Square.",Pope Francis,politics news
201,2023-04-02,CBS News,Here are the latest tech layoffs as the industry shudders,"MoneyWatch The high-flying tech industry is facing a reckoning as the economy slows and customers pull back on spending.In the past month alone, tech companies have cut nearly 60,000 jobs, reversing a hiring spree that surged during the  as millions of Americans moved their lives online. IBM was one of the latest to slash its headcount, announcing 3,900 layoffs in January, or less than 2% of its global workforce. Even with the surge in layoffs, most tech companies are still vastly larger than they were three years ago. But industry analysts expect further industry cuts in 2023 as the Federal Reserve continues to increase interest rates as it hits the brakes on economic growth. This year, ""a major theme will be tech layoffs as Silicon Valley, after a decade of hyper growth, now comes to the reality of cost-cutting mode,"" analysts at Wedbush said in a research note Friday.As for what that means for tech workers, it's too soon to tell, experts say. Despite the cascade of layoff announcements, employment in the information sector rose through most of last year, dropping only in December. That suggests demand for talent remains strong enough that many laid-off tech employees will likely be able to find new jobs.""While layoffs from high-profile firms make the headlines, plenty of  firms are desperate for more workers, especially tech workers. Those  workers are in high demand from the auto industry to the Department of  Veterans Affairs to not-for-profits,"" said Robert Frick, corporate  economist at Navy Federal Credit Union.""The labor market is still  so tight that many tech workers, and workers with other skills, are  snapped up well before they need to collect an unemployment check. And  they are more likely to be snapped up by smaller firms, which have a  much greater demand for workers than major corporations.The tech downturn is an anomaly amid a job market that remains the tightest in decades and has allowed many workers to command higher pay. Across the economy, announced layoffs last year fell to their second-lowest in 30 years of tracking by outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, second only to 2021.But even as overall layoffs fell, tech layoffs rose, with a record 1 in 4 layoffs last year taking place in the tech sector.Here are the largest tech companies to announce cuts since 2022.The Google parent  on January 20 that it would let go of 12,000 workers, or about 6% of its 186,000-strong global workforce. The cuts apply ""across Alphabet — product areas, functions, levels and regions,"" CEO Sundar Pichai said.Pichai told employees that the Silicon Valley company simply hired too fast during the pandemic. ""Over the past two years we've seen periods of dramatic growth,"" Pichai wrote in an email that was also posted on Alphabet's corporate . ""To match and fuel that growth, we hired for a different economic reality than the one we face today.""The e-commerce company is moving to cut about 18,000 positions, a downshift that began in November and that will continue into this year. That's just a fraction of its 1.5 million-strong global workforce. While the vast majority of the company's employees work in its vast warehouse and logistics operation — which doubled in size during the pandemic — the cuts mostly affect white-collar employees in some of the company's less profitable sectors, including the division responsible for its voice assistant, Alexa.The online car seller cut about 2,500 workers in May 2022, or 12% of its workforce. The company was  for its handling of the layoffs, many of which were done via Zoom and email. The Phoenix-based company, which delivers new and used cars to buyers, blamed the cuts on an ""automotive recession.""The cryptocurrency trading platform , or about 950 jobs, in January. It's the second round of layoffs in less than a year, with 1,100 workers losing their jobs . The computer company in February announced it would  due to a ""challenging global economic environment."" The Texas-based company has about 133,000 employees, according to its most recent annual report, putting the layoffs on track to eliminate about 6,600 jobs.The online marketplace said in February it would cut 500 jobs, or about 4% of its global workforce, according to an internal email included with a securities .The layoffs allow the company ""to invest and create new roles in high-potential areas,"" CEO Jamie Iannone said in the message. The will also ""[simplify] our structure to make decisions more effectively and with more speed,"" he said.The company plans to cut about 3,900 workers, its chief financial officer told  in January. The cuts amount to about 1.5% of the company's global  workforce, and come even as IBM posted better-than-expected revenue for  the most recent quarter. The Armonk, New York-based firm will continue  hiring in what its financial officer called ""higher-growth areas."" IBM last year said it would invest tens of billions of dollars across New York's Hudson Valley to spur semiconductor . The ride-hailing service said in November it was cutting 13% of its workforce, almost 700 employees. The layoffs affect its corporate employees, since Lyft's army of drivers are considered independent businesses, not employees of the transportation company. The parent company of Facebook in November , about 13% of its workforce. Meta has struggled more than many tech companies this year; its user base has shrunk, while CEO Mark Zuckerberg has put billions of dollars into building what he calls the ""metaverse,"" to the consternation of its investors. The company's stock has lost  since peaking in August 2021.The software company in January said it , almost 5% of its workforce, as it refocuses its strategy on artificial intelligence and away from hardware. In the two years ending in June 2022, Microsoft had expanded from 163,000 workers to 221,000.The digital payments company said in January it was cutting 2,000 jobs, or about 7% of its workforce, as it contends with what it called ""the challenging macro-economic environment."" The San Jose, California-based company is the parent of PayPal is the parent of payment apps Venmo and Xoom and the coupon service Honey, among other brands. PayPal said the cuts would affect different brands unequally, although it did not specify further.The company, whose app helped attract a new generation of investors to the market, announced in August that it would reduce its headcount by 23%, or approximately 780 people. That's the second round of recent layoffs for the company, which last year cut 9% of its workforce.The company , or about 7,300 employees, in January. It also said it was closing some offices, citing a ""challenging"" environment and lower customer spending. The parent company of social media platform Snapchat said in August that it was letting go of 20% of its staff. Snap's staff has grown to more than 5,600 employees in recent years, meaning that, even after laying off more than 1,000 people, Snap's staff would be larger than it was a year earlier.The music streaming service  in January it was cutting 6% of its workforce, or roughly 580 jobs, as part of a push to make the company more efficient. In 2022, Spotify's operating costs grew twice as fast as its revenue, CEO Daniel Ek said, a pace he called ""unsustainable.""""We still spend far too much time syncing on slightly different strategies, which slows us down,"" CEO Daniel Elk said in a January 23  to employees posted on the company's site. ""And in a challenging economic environment, efficiency takes on greater importance.""The payment processor announced layoffs of roughly 1,000 workers in November,  amounting to 14% of its workforce. In an to employees posted on Stripe's website, CEO Patrick Collison said the company expected ""leaner times"" amid worsening economic conditions.About half of the social media platform's staff of 7,500  after the billionaire CEO of Tesla, Elon Musk, acquired the service in October. An unknown number have left, with some objecting to the new ownership and Musk's demand for an ""extremely hardcore"" attitude.The online shopping company announced in January that it would , or about 10% of its global employees, as it adjusts to falling consumer demand after the home-renovation boom of the pandemic. It's the second round of layoffs for the Boston-based company, which cut .CEO Niraj Shah said the company ""simply grew too big.""""In hindsight, similar to our technology peers, we scaled our spend too quickly over the last few years,"" Shah said in a statement.Yahoo plans to cut about 20% of its workforce, or roughly 1,700 jobs,  over 2023, the company said in . Nearly half the cuts will be in Yahoo's  unprofitable business ad tech unit, which has not delivered as expected. ""Despite many years of effort and investment, this strategy was not  profitable and struggled to live up to our high standards across the  entire stack,"" Yahoo said in a statement. The company has been owned by private  equity firm Apollo Global Management since 2021.The video-conferencing company that surged early in the pandemic said it would lay off 1,300 ""talented, hardworking colleagues"" in early February. The cuts represent about 15% of Zoom's workforce, according to a company blog.The company tripled in size in 2020 as white-collar workers shifted to remote environments, but its user growth then slowed dramatically. ""We didn't take as much time as we should have to thoroughly analyze our  teams or assess if we were growing sustainably,"" CEO Eric Yuan said in a . ""[T]he uncertainty of  the global economy, and its effect on our customers, means we need to  take a hard – yet important – look inward to reset ourselves so we can  weather the economic environment, deliver for our customers and achieve  Zoom's long-term vision,"" he added.Yuan said he would forgo his entire salary and bonus for the current fiscal year, and that the executive team would see 20% salary cuts and no bonus. Yuan made $320,000 in compensation last year, and also holds about $3.3 million worth of Zoom stock, according to securities filings.","Google, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce, Snapchat, Unemployment, Facebook, Robinhood, COVID-19 Pandemic, Meta, Pandemic, Inflation, Lyft, Federal Reserve",environment news
202,2023-04-02,CBS News,Here's how professionals in 3 different fields are using ChatGPT for work,"MoneyWatch In the three months since artificial intelligence tool ChatGPT was introduced to the world, workers have already harnessed it to make their lives easier. Professionals in fields including real estate, health care and finance say they save time and work more efficiently using AI.Here's how these workers described using the tool in their day-to-day jobs.Mala Sander, a top  real estate agent for the Corcoran Group who  focuses on the Hamptons, has been using ChatGPT regularly for the past  couple of weeks to help her write real estate listings and devise  marketing strategies for properties. ""I asked it to write me ad  copy about a house in Bridgehampton with a pool and tennis court on two  acres and I listed the other features I wanted to highlight,"" she told  CBS MoneyWatch. ""And it would weave this fantastic copy into something  that you could actually use.""She uses  ChatGPT to change the tone of listings too. ""I'll say things like,  'write this toward a millennial audience' or 'make it funny.'""Her routine these days is to have her team write the first draft of a listing ""and crunch it through to see if ChatGPT can edit it down and make it more concise,"" she said.On a whim, she asked the bot to write her a marketing plan for one of her listings. It delivered. It gave her a breakdown of a campaign that would include digital, print and social outreach, she told CBS MoneyWatch. ""It talked about everything from direct mail to online digital advertising to social media, and it even came up with some percentages that might be ideal,"" Sander said.Having worked as an agent for the last 20 years, Sander is quite capable and efficient without ChatGPT. ""But it is useful,"" she said. ""It's like talking to another person, almost like having work therapist to say, 'Am I moving in the right direction with this or should be looking at some other things?'""Elia Mazor, marketing manager for The Glazer Team at Corcoran, said he also uses ChatGPT to  and create other content. ""Sometimes you get writer's block, so I use ChatGPT for a bit of inspiration and to provide a different tone,"" he said.Certified financial planner Michael Reynolds uses the chatbot to  help him draft blog posts that educate his clients about  financial documents like wills and trusts. He tells ChatGPT the  topic he wants to address, and enters a prompt like: ""ChatGPT, create an  introduction on why estate planning is important."" It spits out paragraphs that Reynolds then edits in his own voice.In a recent article on estate planning, Reynolds relied on ChatGPT to hook readers by driving home the message that ""estate planning .""""I asked ChatGPT to explain that and it put together a few paragraphs on why it's thoughtful and considerate to do these things,"" Reynolds said. The process took about 20 minutes. If he'd worked on the article alone, it would have taken closer to two hours, he said.He  doesn't use the tool to help clients make financial decisions — that's  still a job exclusively for humans, according to Reynolds. ""Financial  planning is so nuanced, individualized and personal. It is hard to  envision using ChatGPT to spit out recommendations without it  knowing the client. I see it being more valuable in generating  educational material to supplement what I am doing,"" he said. ""We don't  just crunch numbers; we coach people, listen to their concerns and help  them talk through emotional situations. The creative, empathetic work we  do as humans is irreplaceable as of today.""Nick Meyer, another , said he uses it as a starting point to come up with ideas for new content. ""I use it instead of Google search to get topic ideas, or to edit what I have already written,"" he said. It also helps him make his videos funny.  ""I can insert a couple lines of a script and say, 'Make this more comedic, insert a joke on this line, or make it more concise,"" Meyer said.Board-certified emergency physician Harvey Castro is advising digital health companies on how to best integrate ChatGPT into the health care sector. He says one good application is creating and translating patient discharge instructions — rules for them to follow after a medical visit. An expert in emergency medicine, if he were asked a dermatology-related question he was unsure about, Castro said he'd enter the query into ChatGPT for more information. In the past, he relied on other clinical search engines and resources like MDConsult, now called ClinicalKey. ""I could type it in and it would give me gobs of information. So it's a supplement,"" Castro said. Doctors are also using it to enter a patient's symptoms and have it return a differential diagnosis — a list of possible conditions related to the presenting symptoms, according to Castro. ""That is already happening today,"" he said. Rushabh Doshi, a second-year medical student at Yale University School of Medicine, likes to use ChatGPT to create sample questions while he studies for the U.S. Medical Licensing Examination. Test prep services have limited practice questions, and ChatGPT can generate new ones on any topic based on the prompt he feeds it. It helps him prepare for some patient interactions, too, but uses it strictly for medical education and not patient care.""If there is a patient coming in with a disease I am not familiar with, I can go to ChatGPT and read up on it,"" he said. It also gives him information that helps him conduct more thorough patient evaluations. ""I ask it to give me a guide of the types of questions to ask to make sure I am doing a comprehensive patient interview.""","Real Estate, Health Care, ChatGPT",environment news

204,2023-04-02,CBS News,"Transcript: Sen. Chris Murphy on ""Face the Nation,"" April 2, 2023","CBS News MARGARET BRENNAN: And we are joined now by Connecticut Democratic Senator Chris Murphy. Good morning to you, Senator. SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: We have you here after some of the most tragic events in our country, and this week, three of the victims were just 9-years-old. This was a private Catholic school, or excuse me Christian School attached to a church. And people who survived that now know their teachers, their parents, their caregivers cannot keep them safe. Do we need to shift the conversation to supporting more trauma treatment? Is that where we are?SEN. MURPHY: I think we have to do all of the above. I mean, there's no doubt that our kids are going through something unique today. I just don't understand why we choose to live like this. Why we choose to make our kids fear for their lives when they walk into their schools, why we choose to have children who grew up in violent neighborhoods fear for their lives when they walk to and from school. Only in America does this happen. And you can't explain it through a prism of mental illness or a lack of school security. The thing that's different in the United States is the number of guns, the number of high powered weapons of mass destruction and the ease with which we allow criminals and dangerously mentally ill people to get those guns. So we've got to change the nation's gun laws. We've got to put more trauma resources into our schools. But doing nothing cannot be an option. More school shootings than days in the year so far in 2023.MARGARET BRENNAN: One of the things you said this week is you would look to require more training for people buying automatic weapons. Explain that because- would that require more vetting of the person doing the buy?SEN. MURPHY: So last year, we passed the first gun safety measure, bipartisan in 30 years. And we did that because we found common ground. Listen, I-MARGARET BRENNAN: After Uvalde.SEN. MURPHY: After Uvalde. I want to ban assault weapons? I think it's just absolutely unconscionable that we allow these weapons of war to be in commercial circulation. MARGARET BRENNAN: But there aren't the votes to do that. SEN. MURPHY: But there's not the votes to do that. So what are there the votes to do? Let's explore the potential of what's possible. And so what if we said before you get an AR-15, you have to show that you are responsible, that you know how to operate it, what if we applied background checks universally, simply to the purchase of those weapons. Ultimately, I want those weapons off the street. But I think we'd be a safer nation if we required just a little bit of training before you bought the most dangerous weapons commercially available.MARGARET BRENNAN: So the shooter in Tennessee apparently went to five different places, bought seven different weapons. Tennessee doesn't have a red flag law. It's unclear if it would have made a difference here since the parents of the shooter apparently claimed not to know the guns existed. But shouldn't the purchasing itself, stockpiling weapons set off some kind of alarm somewhere?SEN. MURPHY: I think that the different states have different laws that would require some of those triggers for law enforcement. MARGARET BRENNAN: But not in Tennessee.SEN. MURPHY: But not in Tennessee and I- and I do think that a proper red flag law in Tennessee could have made a difference here. If parents know that they have the opportunity to take firearms away from an individual in their family that they know is in crisis, then they are frankly going to be more vigilant about searching for that potential connection to a weapon. In Tennessee, they couldn't do anything about it even if they knew about the weapons. And so what we know is that in states that have red flag laws, they are used responsibly and frequently to take guns away from people in crisis. Florida, a red state, has a red flag law that's been used 8,000 times to take weapons away from people who are contemplating violence against others, or contemplating violence against themselves. They- they work and if Tennessee had a red flag law, and the parents knew about it maybe this situation wouldn't have happened,MARGARET BRENNAN: The bill that you co-sponsored provided financial incentives for states to create red flag laws. Tennessee apparently just doesn't want one.SEN. MURPHY: Yeah. Tennessee is moving the other way. Right. Tennessee is talking about allowing you to be able to carry loaded assault weapons on the streets. What we know is that states that have tougher, tighter gun laws have dramatically lower rates of gun violence. And so in Connecticut, our rate of gun violence is half that- one-third that of Tennessee. So my hope is that this new federal funding that we passed on a bipartisan basis last year will prompt states like Tennessee to take a look at red flag laws. They're wildly popular. 80% of Americans want them. There's no political risk in enacting a red flag law. If Tennessee had it, maybe this wouldn't have happened.MARGARET BRENNAN: Tennessee's Governor, a Republican, is reportedly proposing funneling millions now into new school security measures including grants for private schools like where this happened to have armed guards. A version of this was brought up on the Senate floor. You had a pretty heated exchange with Senator Ted Cruz. But explain why you think he's wrong when he says this.*SOT*SENATOR TED CRUZ: I do not understand why our Democrat colleagues in this body do not support having police officers keep our kids safe. Why when it comes to this issue, the only thing that interests them is disarming the people at home who pose no threat, rather than protecting our kids.*END SOT*SEN. MURPHY: So Senator Cruz opposed our bipartisan legislation last year that would take weapons away from domestic abusers. So when he says that our interest is only in taking weapons away from people who pose no threat, he's squarely out of touch with the American people who don't think that domestic abusers should have guns. And what Senator Cruz's  legislation is talking about is not just putting police officers with guns in schools, but teachers in our schools with firearms. My constituents in Connecticut, they want school security, they want door locks, they want more physical protection, but they do not want their teachers to be handed AR-15s. Our schools loaded up with weapons. What we know in this country is that more weapons don't equal less crime. If more weapons equaled less crime, then we would be one of the safest places in the worldMARGARET BRENNAN: His fellow Texas Senator John Cornyn, who was your partner last time said we've gone as far as we can go unless somebody identifies some area we didn't address. We heard President Biden say, I'm done here. So is this really up to grassroots groups and state governments at this point? Is that the reality?SEN. MURPHY: Listen, I think if you had asked pundits, two months before we passed last year's bipartisan bill, whether Congress was going to act on guns in 2022, people would have said it wasn't going to happen. Things change pretty quickly in Washington. And my goal is to try to find that common ground that John Cornyn is talking about, I'm not going to let the perfect be the enemy of the good. We've got to show parents and kids and families in this country that we can make bipartisan progress, to try to make our country safer. That's why I'm talking not about an assault weapons ban this year but around training, around raising the age, around background checks, just trying to make some progress to make sure that weapons are only getting into the hands of law abiding citizens. So I'm open for any discussion with Republicans about how we can show this country that we take their kids' protection seriously, doing nothing for Republicans on both sides of the aisle, conservative parents and progressive parents right now is not an option.MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Murphy, thank you for your time. SEN.

205,2023-04-02,CBS News,Cybercriminals are using AI voice cloning tools to dupe victims,"MoneyWatch If you answer a phone call from an unknown number, let the caller speak first. Whoever is on the other end of the line could be recording snippets of your voice — and later using it to impersonate you in a very convincing manner. That's according to the Federal Trade Commission, which is  consumers to beware of scam artists who are secretly recording people's voices in order to later pose as them and ask victims' relatives for money. The FTC described such a scenario amid the rise of AI-powered tools like ChatGPT and Microsoft's Vall-E, a tool the software company demonstrated in January that converts text to speech. Vall-E is not yet available to the public, but other companies, like Resemble AI and ElevenLabs, make similar tools that are. Using a short sample of anyone's voice, this technology can accurately convert written sentences into convincing sounding audio.""You get a call. There's a panicked voice on the line. It's your grandson. He says he's in deep trouble — he wrecked the car and landed in jail. But you can help by sending money. You take a deep breath and think. You've heard about grandparent scams. But darn, it sounds just like him,"" FTC consumer education specialist Alvaro Puig wrote on the agency's site.Criminals are employing widely available ""voice cloning"" tools to dupe victims into believing their loved ones are in trouble and need cash fast, experts say. All it requires is a short clip of someone's voice, which is sometimes available on the internet — or if it isn't, can be collected by recording a spam call — plus a voice-cloning app such as  AI speech software, VoiceLab. ""If you made a TikTok video with your voice on it, that's enough,"" Hany Farid, a digital forensics professor at the University of California at Berkeley, told . Even a voice mailbox recording would suffice, for example. He's not surprised such scams are proliferating. ""This is part of a continuum. We started with the spam calls, then email phishing scams, then text message phishing scams. So this is the natural evolution of these scams,"" Farid said.What this means in practice, according to the FTC, is that you can no longer trust voices that sound identical to those of your friends and family members.""Don't trust the voice,"" the FTC warns. ""Call the person who supposedly contacted you and verify the story. Use a phone number you know is theirs. If you can't reach your loved one, try to get in touch with them through another family member or their friends.""Vall-E maker Microsoft alluded to this problem, including a disclaimer in a paper demonstrating the technology that ""it may carry potential risks in misuse of the model, such as spoofing voice identification or impersonating a specific speaker."" The paper noted that if the tool is rolled out to the general public, it ""should include a protocol to ensure that the speaker approves the use of their voice.""In January, ElevenLabs , ""We also see an increasing number of voice cloning misuse cases.""For this reason, the company said that identity verification is essential to weed out malicious content and that the tech will only be available for a fee. With bad actors using voice cloning software to mimic voices and commit crimes, it's important to be vigilant. First, if you answer a call from an unknown number, let the caller speak first. If you say as much as ""Hello? Who is this?"" they could use that audio sample to impersonate you. Farid said he no longer answers his phone unless he's expecting a call. And when he receives calls from supposed family members, like his wife, that seem ""off,"" he asks her for a code word that they've agreed upon.""Now we even mispronounce it, too, if we suspect someone else knows it,"" he told CBS MoneyWatch. ""It's like a password you don't share with anybody. It's a pretty easy way to circumvent this, as long as you have wherewithal to ask and not panic.""It's a low-tech way to combat a high-tech issue. The FTC also warns consumers not to trust incoming calls from unknown parties and advises people to verify calls claiming to be from friends or family members in another way — such as by calling the person on a known number or reaching out to mutual friends.Additionally, when someone asks for payment via money wire, gift card or in cryptocurrency, those can also be red flags. ""Scammers ask you to pay or send money in ways that make it hard to get your money back,"" the FTC said.","Federal Trade Commission, Artificial Intelligence",environment news
206,2023-04-02,CBS News,How your ex could boost your Social Security benefits,"AP Katja Rivera, 64, is a massage therapist and theater director in Berkeley, California, who said she's never earned more than about $30,000 a year. When her two daughters were small, she sometimes earned much less.But Rivera was married for 10 years to a man who has consistently earned much more than she has. When Rivera retires in a few years, she expects to receive a Social Security check based on her ex's greater earnings.Many divorced people don't realize they can get  benefits derived from their ex-spouse's work history, said William Meyer, founder of Social Security Solutions, a website that helps people determine when and how to claim Social Security. Those who are aware of the benefits often misunderstand crucial details and can make decisions that cost them tens of thousands of dollars over their lifetimes, he said.Here are the basics: You may qualify for benefits based on your ex's work record if your marriage lasted at least 10 years. Any benefit you receive won't affect the amounts your ex, your ex's current spouse or any of your ex's other ex-spouses will receive.However, the rules for these benefits depend on whether your ex is alive or dead.If your ex is still alive and you haven't remarried, you may qualify for divorced spousal benefits. This benefit could be up to 50% of what the ex would get at full retirement age, which is currently between age 66 and 67.You would get a divorced spousal benefit only if it's greater than the amount you've earned on your own work record when you apply. Social Security pays the higher of the two amounts — not both. Divorced spousal benefits end if you remarry.To apply, you must be at least 62. Your ex must be at least 62 as well, or receiving Social Security disability benefits. If your ex is entitled to retirement benefits but hasn't started them, at least two years must have passed since the divorce for you to qualify for a divorced spousal benefit.However, applying for Social Security too early has some significant costs. Your benefits are permanently reduced if you apply before your own full retirement age. Your payment also would be subject to the earnings test, which withholds $1 for each $2 you earn over a certain amount: For 2023, that number is $21,240.Making the right choice is important because you can't switch from a divorced spousal benefit to your own benefit later — even if your own is eventually larger. (Your own retirement benefit can grow over time if you continue to work. In addition, you can earn ""delayed retirement credits"" that increase your retirement benefit by 8% for each year you put off applying, between your full retirement age and 70, when benefits max out.)If Rivera's ex dies before she does, she could be eligible for a different payment: divorced survivor benefits.This benefit is more generous in many ways. The divorced survivor benefit can be up to 100% of what your ex was receiving. You can apply for this benefit as early as age 60, or age 50 if you're disabled. As with divorced spousal benefits, the amount will be reduced and subject to the earnings test if you start before your own full retirement age.But you can be married and still get divorced survivor benefits based on an ex's work record, as long as you remarried at 60 or older. Plus, you can switch from a divorced survivor's benefit to your own benefit later. For example, you could start with a divorced survivor benefit as early as age 60 and then change to your own retirement benefit at 70, if it's larger.Rivera is confident that half of her ex's benefit amount will be more than her own, even if she waits to apply until her own retirement benefit maxes out at 70. To know for sure, though, she'd need to ask her ex to share his Social Security statement — something she's not comfortable doing.You can easily check your own earnings record and projected benefit amounts by setting up a ""my Social Security"" account at . These figures can help you calculate how to maximize your benefit, using free claiming calculators like the one at  or more sophisticated paid calculators, such as Social Security Solutions (starting at $20) or Maximize My Social Security (starting at $39).But you can't get similar access to an ex's record, Meyer notes. Without asking your ex to share their statement, you may not know how much your divorced benefits are worth until you actually apply. That can make it tough to plan ahead and maximize your lifetime Social Security income, Meyer said.""Even though you may not want to call your ex, this may be the one time it's worth making a phone call,"" he said.","Social Security, AARP",environment news

""I would hope to be retired, playing the piano again, just enjoying my life,"" O'Connor said. With no savings or 401(k) — not even enough to cover an emergency — she sold her home and bought a smaller one with two other women. ""It's been a matter of life and death,"" she said of her current financial situation. Millions of Americans  are still financially unprepared for retirement. According to U.S. Census Bureau data, 50% of women and 47% of men between the ages of 55 and 66 have no retirement savings. O'Connor, who adopted and raised three children as a single mother, said she knew she would be in that group. ""I have a live-for-now philosophy, I guess,"" O'Connor said. For her and others without a nest egg, experts said it is not too late to make a plan. According to the AARP, that includes continuing to work, lowering your cost of living, saving when you can and delaying social security benefits until age 70 in order to get the largest monthly check possible. You should also avoid risky investments that you think will make up for the lost time. ""The higher the promised returns, the more you want to do in real research before you put your money in something like that,"" said David John, a senior policy adviser for the AARP Public Policy Institute. According to AARP, nearly 57 million Americans work for an employer that does not offer a retirement savings plan. O'Connor said her advice to young people is to start saving now. ""I wish I had started earlier,"" O'Connor said. ""But I guess I would now say that they need to start planning as early as they can.""As for O'Connor, she's continuing to work.

209,2023-04-02,CBS News,"One way to fix Social Security? ""Smash the cap""","MoneyWatch Social Security is heading for a funding cliff, with its trust fund reserves  by 2033 — an outcome that would mean beneficiaries would face a 25% shave on their monthly checks. But there is a way to fix most of the funding shortfall, policy experts say: ""Smash the cap.""That refers to the Social Security tax cap, a feature of the program since it was launched in the 1930s following the Great Depression. Essentially, any income over the earnings cap isn't subject to the Social Security payroll tax, which is 6.2% for workers and an additional 6.2% for employers. In 2023, the tax cap stands at $160,200, which means any income above that amount is exempt from the payroll tax. As a result, middle- and lower-income workers bear a much greater tax burden in funding Social Security than the 6% of Americans who earn above the threshold, according a new  from the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research. ""If you make over that cap, like 6% of the population does, you could be paying 1% of your income or even less than that,"" noted Sarah Rawlins, program associate at CEPR. Yet a middle-income worker earning less than the $160,200 cap in 2023 will pay an effective tax rate that is six times higher than the millionaire's tax burden, she noted. That's why the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), a federal agency that provides financial analyses of policy issues, calls the Social Security tax cap """" — middle- and low-income workers pay a much greater share of their income toward the program than the rich. Eliminating or lifting the tax cap could help stabilize Social Security's trust fund by providing more revenue to the program, Rawlins said. A December  by the CBO found that eliminating the cap for earnings over $250,000 would keep the trust fund solvent through 2046.Meanwhile, some lawmakers are proposing changes that include both getting rid of the tax cap and other changes to address Social Security's funding challenges. Senator Bernie Sanders, an Independent from Vermont, and Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, in February  that would stabilize the trust fund for the next 75 years.Among their plans: Lift the tax cap for people earning $250,000, and add the Social Security tax to investment and business income, which is currently exempt from the tax. Others oppose raising taxes on higher-income Americans as the answer to fixing Social Security. Last year, the Republican Study Committee, a group of House conservatives,  the retirement age for claiming Social Security to age 70, up from today's full retirement age of 66 to 67 years old. While House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has said Social Security won't be on the chopping block during the ongoing debt ceiling debate, pushing the retirement age higher isn't a new approach. For instance, the full retirement age was 65 until 1983, when changes to the program took into account the fact that Americans were living longer and the retirement age was raised to 66 or 67 (depending on one's birth year).Americans' longer lifespans are part of the argument that Republican lawmakers make in favor of lifting the Social Security retirement age: the ""miracle"" of longer life expectancy means that workers can wait to get their benefits, according to Republican Study Committee's . Regardless of whether people can actually work until they are 70, raising the retirement age is effectively a benefits cut because today's workers would lose out on between three and four years of benefits. Based on the average Social Security benefit for retirees, raising the retirement age to 70 would equate to a loss of at least $65,000 in payments for the typical beneficiary. Still, with a divided Congress, for now it's unlikely that either the Democrats or Republicans could push through their changes to stabilize Social Security.",Social Security,environment news

That's to help prevent users from taking on more debt to repay the loans. ""Apple not allowing customers to link to a credit card is a unique feature in its BNPL product that should limit the ability of borrowers to pay off one form of debt with another form of debt, though it does not fully address our broader concerns over the structural and cyclical challenges the buy-now-pay-later business model continues to face,"" Michael Taiano, senior director, Fitch Ratings said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.In 2021, buy now, pay later loans totaled $24 billion, up from $2 billion in 2019, according to a CFPB .

211,2023-04-02,CBS News,Why TikTok faces bans in the U.S.,"CBS News is the most popular app in the United States. 150 million Americans – almost half the population – use it every month. The app offers an endless, scrolling wonderland of humor, music, dancing, tips, opinion and information – short videos posted by fellow TikTok fans, and all delivered to you according to your interests. And for about five million businesses, TikTok is also a marketing tool.Baedri Nichole, founder of a bakery in Columbus, Ohio, said of TikTok, ""It's taught me how to do e-commerce, how to get into shipping. and more than anything, I also use it to find my next customer.  Prior to getting on TikTok, we were struggling even to turn a profit.""And now? ""We've seen at least a 300% increase in profit,"" she said. So, if Americans love TikTok so much, why has Congress proposed so many bills that could  the app?And why, during a Congressional hearing last month, did TikTok's CEO Shou Chew face comments like this one from Rep. Kathryn Cammack (R-Fla.): ""You damn well know that you cannot protect the data and security of this committee, or the 150 million users of your app""?  Congress has four primary concerns about TikTok. First, that TikTok collects data about you; second, that kids get addicted to spending time on TikTok; and third, that people can find misinformation and violence. Of course, all of this is also true about ,  or . So, what's the difference? Chinese influence. ""TikTok has a parent company named ByteDance, and ByteDance is a Chinese company that has to cooperate with the Chinese Communist Party,"" said Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.).Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.) said, ""All social media is not necessarily great for kids, but that is a fundamental distinction in terms of dealing with the TikTok issue.""Krishnamoorthi and Gallagher are co-sponsors of one of the ""Ban TikTok"" bills. And their biggest worry is control of information. Gallagher said, ""The thing that most concerns me, however, is the ability to control what storylines Americans see, or don't see, and ultimately influence our elections, which could be catastrophic in the future.""However, Milton Mueller, a professor of cybersecurity and public policy at Georgia Tech, studied the theory that TikTok's algorithms attempt to influence ideology. He said, ""There's absolutely no indication that this is in some way manipulated or controlled by the Chinese Communist Party. We just found that to be a complete fabrication. You can find information about Uyghur repression, you can find information that ridicules Xi Jinping. It's all there.""In the heat of the battle, both TikTok execs and Congress members sometimes stretch the truth. Take, for example, the business of data collection. At the Congressional hearing on TikTok, Rep. Cathy Rodgers (R-Wash.) said, ""TikTok collects nearly every data point imaginable.""Mueller disputes this: ""There have been three technical studies done of this. They basically all say it is exactly what they tell you it is in their privacy statement.""Like every social-media app, TikTok collects data like your phone model, its internet IP address, and your time zone. Unlike other apps, TikTok does  know your name or your GPS location. It knows only your general area, like what town you're in. So, where does this all leave us? Gallagher and Krishnamoorthi's bill, called the Anti-Social CCP Act (HR 1081), intends to force the issue. ""It would basically allow for two outcomes in this case,"" said Gallagher. ""One would be a ban of the app altogether; or it would allow for a sale to an American company.""Pogue asked, ""Hasn't somebody in your immediate circle said, 'Guys, banning TikTok will be a political disaster'?"" ""Well, I would say allowing this to continue would be a geopolitical disaster,"" Gallagher replied. ""And that, to me, is far more important than angering some teenagers.""So, sell TikTok, or ban it? Selling it might be impossible – though worth a lot, the Chinese Communist Party may object to a sale. As for banning TikTok, Mueller said, ""There's probably a 90% chance that that would be ruled unconstitutional [because of] the First Amendment. You're banning an information source, you're banning a publication. I have to emphasize this: if you ban TikTok, it's not the Chinese Government that would be silenced; it's the 150 million American users of the app. Those are the ones whose free speech rights would be violated by a ban.""But TikTok is proposing a third option. CEO Shou Chew mentioned it frequently in his testimony: ""Project Texas"" is a proposal to move TikTok's entire operation to the U.S., to put all of its data, and even those top-secret algorithms, under the supervision of Oracle, an American company. ""The bottom line is this: American data stored on American soil by an American company overseen by American personnel,"" said Shou. ""This eliminates the concern that some of you have shared with me that TikTok user data can be subject to Chinese law.""Congress isn't sold. Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), said to Shou, ""I still believe that the Beijing Communist government will still control and have the ability to influence what you do.""Mueller believes that attacking TikTok is an easy way for politicians to look tough on China: ""TikTok is a symbolic way for these people to attack even the most innocent forms of interaction between the Chinese digital economy and the U.S. digital economy."" As for Baedri Nichole, she's become a ""Save TikTok"" activist. TikTok even flew her and 25 other fans to Washington, to join a rally against the ban. Nichole has some advice for Congress: ""After the Congressional hearing, it was very clear that you may not have done all of your due diligence that you owe us as your constituents. You really need to get on the app and have a better understanding of the decisions being made, and how it's going to affect the greater good of the people.""","Social Media, TikTok",environment news

213,2023-04-02,CBS News,Inflation is pushing more Americans into side hustles,"MoneyWatch Nearly half of American workers today have a side hustle to earn extra cash, showing the toll inflation has taken on working people, according to a new report.In a  released this week from LendingTree and PYMNTS, one-third of respondents said they had a second job, while 1 in 6 said they got supplemental income in another way, including commissions, selling goods online or gambling profits. ""Inflation has made life more and more expensive, and consumers have already made moves to cope, such as pulling back on discretionary expenses. But one can only pull back so far on spending, and PYMNTS' data reveals that consumers are finding another way to navigate their lower purchasing power,"" the report said. The report suggests that the multiple-hustle set is much larger than the  government's official figures, which put multiple-job holders at around  5% of the workforce. And the figures are likely growing: More than half of the study's respondents said the amount of money they made from side gigs had increased in the prior three months.""You can point to inflation as a major reason why people are interested in taking these [side] jobs,"" said Kathy Kristof, founder of , a review site for gig work. Kristof, a former CBS News contributor, said she has seen a huge rush to gig work among young retirees, people in their 60s who had retired only to be walloped by rising prices.""You thought you had enough money saved, or you thought you had a pension that would pay for everything, and suddenly everything increases in cost,"" she said.Younger Americans may be facing a different set of inflation-driven challenges. ""It's either because of the things they bought and financed, or the thing they want to buy with financing, like a car or a home,"" Kristof said. ""It's twice as expensive to buy a house right now than it was about a year ago. If you have variable-rate debt, you're also suffering.""Gen Z consumers were the most likely to report side income in the LendingTree survey, with fully two-thirds of respondents saying they earned money on the side. A majority of millennials also reported having a side hustle. Among those with a second job, one in four said they were pushed into it by extraordinary expenses or a main job that didn't cover the bills. For consumers who sold goods online, one in three said they did it to pay off surprise expenses.But the most common reason people gave for a side job or selling online was surprising: That the extra income was ""easy to earn,"" according to the survey.According to Kristof, that's the silver lining for the current inflationary times: If you're pushed into trying to make an extra buck, there's a plethora of opportunities to do so. The gig ecosystem has grown in the last few years, and in addition to the rote work of driving passengers or delivering food, there are many other opportunities that call for a range of skills and pay decent money. Kristof said she's been surprised by the explosion of marketing platforms offering good rates to people adept with TikTok or Instagram. Demand for online tutors has also surged in the last few years, as parents with means try to counter their children's pandemic-disrupted learning. Tutors in science and math fields can earn $50 to $100 an hour, she said. ""Like everything else, you have to have specialized skills in this market to really thrive,"" she said. And for those who don't have the time or inclination to pick up more work,  she suggested taking a look at what they own. Nearly anything from a car to equipment can be shared on a rental platform. This option may be particularly appealing to older workers or retirees who don't want to return to the grind but may have accumulated some assets. ""You can rent out your yard as a dog park, by the hour.

214,2023-04-02,CBS News,Richard Branson's Virgin Orbit to cut 85% of its workforce,"AP Richard Branson's Virgin Orbit is letting go of almost its entire work force with the satellite launch company finding it difficult to secure funding three months after a failed mission.The company, headquartered in Long Beach, California, will cut 675 jobs, about 85% of its workforce, according to a Friday filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Earlier this month, Virgin Orbit said that it was  amid reports that the company would furlough most of its staff. At the time the company confirmed that it was putting all work on hold, but didn't say for how long.In January, a mission by Virgin Orbit to launch the first satellites into orbit from Europe failed after a rocket's upper stage . It was a setback in the United Kingdom which had hoped that the launch from Cornwall in southwest England would mark the beginning of more commercial opportunities for the U.K. space industry.The company said in February that an investigation found that its rocket's fuel filter had become dislodged, causing an engine to become overheated and other components to malfunction over the Atlantic Ocean.Virgin Orbit has completed four successful satellite launches so far from California for a mix of commercial and U.S. government defense uses.Virgin Orbit said in a regulatory filing on Friday that the job cuts will occur in all areas of the company.It expects about $15.5 million in charges related to the job cuts, with the majority of the charges taking place in the first quarter. The company anticipates $8.8 million in severance payments and employee benefits costs and $6.5 million in other employee-related costs.Virgin Orbit anticipates the job cuts being mostly complete by Monday.Virgin Orbit, which is listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange, was founded in 2017 by British billionaire Richard Branson to target the market for launching small satellites into space. Its LauncherOne rockets are launched from the air from modified Virgin passenger planes, allowing the company to operate more flexibly than using fixed launch sites.","Richard Branson, Space",science news
215,2023-04-02,DW News,"German football wants regulation, so regulate it  – DW – 04/02/2023","Bayern Munich's latest 'Klassiker' win over Borussia Dortmund didn’t necessarily portray the Bundesliga in its most positive light. But it was certainly a realistic depiction of where German football finds itself.  is supposed to be the Bundesliga's answer to European football's biggest fixtures, showcasing the best that German football has to offer in a global shop window. It actually does it very well. In fact, it goes even further, offering a much more realistic and truthful reflection of German football in 2023 than the marketing experts behind the 'Der Klassiker' moniker probably ever intended. On the pitch in Munich on Saturday evening, a goalkeeping howler led to Dortmund conceding three goals in ten first-half minutes, ending the game as a contest and setting Bayern on their way to a ninth home win in a row in this fixture, by a combined aggregate score of 37-8. Dortmund may yet turn this title race around. They're only two points behind with eight games to play. Crazier things have happened. But that's not the point. Even if they do manage to , it will take a lot more than that to put them back on a level footing with Bayern Munich. The gulf is simply too big, and will remain so. A decade of domestic dominance and regular deep runs to the latter stages of the Champions League will do that. It ensures that Bayern continually reap a greater share of prize money and broadcast revenue, and allows them to sell sponsorship (and indeed equity) for higher prices than Dortmund can command, let alone the rest of the league. The circle is as vicious and simple as that. So, what to do? Ask , and certain influential tabloid media outlets, and the answer is to scrap the 50+1 rule, which stipulates that German clubs remain under the control of their members, preventing majority takeovers and therefore discouraging It's an answer typical of late-capitalist modern football, and it would probably work to an extent. Superficially, at least. Qatar could buy Bayern, a Chinese consortium could buy Dortmund, and Jeff Bezos could take over Stuttgart. They could all pump in billions of euros and manufacture a title race, or even a Super League if you will. Are you not entertained? The only problem: Unlike in England, where fans of Chelsea, Manchester City and Newcastle United have actively celebrated and welcomed their clubs being bought, or Spain, where support for the idea of a Super League remains strong, there's simply no popular appetite for that in Germany.  On the contrary, rather than financial deregulation, the general tenor across the game is more regulation, more member control, and an even stronger commitment to . Why? Because fans want to protect their affordable match tickets, their communal standing terraces, their vibrant fan culture and their clubs' social engagement. They don't want their clubs owned by nation states and billionaires. They watch the Premier League and they play against English clubs in the Champions League, and they don't like what they see there. That's why, even with their team already 3-0 down on Saturday, and with the sporting and financial gulf between them and Bayern once again playing out before their very eyes, Borussia Dortmund's traveling supporters took part in a pre-planned coordinated pro-50+1 protest, along with their Bayern rivals. ""Everyone is equal,"" read the banner in the home end. ""But some are more equal,"" read the response from the away end, before both sets of fans demanded ""proper implementation of 50+1!""  The banners referred to the recent German Football League (DFL) decision to retain 50+1 in its current form, but also to protect existing exemptions from the rule, namely VfL Wolfsburg and Bayer Leverkusen. But perhaps the focus on 50+1 is missing the point somewhat. After all, it's not Wolfsburg or Leverkusen who have won ten Bundesliga titles in a row. Even RB Leipzig only have a single German Cup, won on penalties, to show for Red Bull's circumvention of league rules. To play this audio please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that Meanwhile, there's ample evidence to suggest that clubs run according to 50+1 can compete if properly managed and supported. Eintracht Frankfurt won the Europa League last season in spectacular fashion, while 100% member-controlled Freiburg reached that German Cup final against RB Leipzig, who were incidentally hammered 3-0 at home by 100% member-controlled Mainz yesterday. There were two further banners displayed on Saturday which were arguably of more relevance. ""Future strategy: Sell out to investors…,” read the message from the Bayern fans, referring to the alternative DFL plan to boost investment in the league by selling equity in a sister company managing the league's broadcast rights. ""… instead of sustainable solutions!” the Dortmund fans completed the sentence. What exactly those ""sustainable solutions” are probably doesn't fit on a banner. But it could feasibly entail a fairer redistribution of broadcast revenues, as detailed in proposals submitted to the league by fan groups back in 2020. As for Bayern Munich, the perennial champions could yet turn out to be the most intriguing battleground in this ideological war over the future of German football, making the current soap opera surrounding the  and the appointment of Thomas Tuchel look like child's play. Despite Bayern being a perfect example of how 50+1 can work (with lucrative sales of 8.33% stakes to Audi, Adidas and Allianz, yet an effective commitment to 75+1 enshrined in the club's constitution), it's no secret that Bayern's club hierarchy would prefer to see the rule scrapped. But they are also well aware that they have a vigilant and well-organized membership keeping a close eye on them ― not least since the club's 2021 annual general meeting descended into chaos over the issue of the Qatar Airways sponsorship. New club president Herbert Hainer was taken aback by that, learning the hard way that being the chief executive of Adidas is not the same as being the democratically-elected representative of 300,000 members of a football club. By all accounts, communication has since improved in Munich. There is a dialogue between club and membership. But suspicions remain, particularly regarding the intentions of CEO Oliver Kahn, who has been engaged in a very public dispute with Lothar Matthäus this week over the nature of the ""values” which the two club legends think Bayern Munich ought to represent. All of this was on show to the world on Saturday. Perhaps ""Der Klassiker” really is a perfect advert for German football after all.",Germany,germany news
216,2023-04-02,DW News,Germany's most popular cycling routes – DW – 03/31/2023,"According to the ADFC's (German Bicycle Association) 2022 bike tour analysis, the most popular bike path in Germany is The Weser Cycle Route. The long-distance cycle path runs about 500 kilometers (310 miles) from the Weser Uplands hills to the North Sea, passing through six regions along the way, including Bremen, Bremerhaven, and Cuxland in the north. It's not necessary to go on a multi-day trip to have a great adventure on your bicycle. There are many great one-day tours around Germany. According to the ADFC the Elbe River Cycle Path ranks second. It runs from the Krkonose Mountains via Dresden (pictured) to Cuxhaven near Hamburg.Following the scent of the sea and the sound of the waves, the Baltic Coast Cycle Route runs more than 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) from Flensburg in the north to Usedom on the Polish border in the east. Cities and towns worth seeing alternate with secluded stretches of coastline and bustling resorts. One highlight lies at the beginning of the route — the moated castle of Glücksburg (pictured).The cycle path begins in Upper Franconia where the Main River emerges and runs 600 kilometers (372 mi) to Mainz, where the river flows into the Rhine. It passes notable cities such as the old episcopal town of Würzburg and the beer city of Bamberg, with tiny villages and varied landscapes in between. The banking metropolis of Frankfurt with its skyscrapers also lies along the route (pictured).The Danube Cycle Route is 2,840 kilometers (1764 mi) long from the source of the German Danube to its delta in Tulcea, Romania. Austria's capital, Vienna, is a definite highlight of the route, which includes a total of eight countries. It is relatively flat and passes through the German cities of Ulm and Passau (pictured), idyllic countryside, vineyards and castles. The Moselle Cycle Path begins in the French city of Metz and ends in Koblenz in Rhineland Palatinate. Between them, the bike path winds its way along the Moselle River for around 310 kilometers (192 mi). Castles, ruins, vineyards and idyllic winegrowing villages line the way. A picnic with a glass of wine overlooking the river and vineyards is not to be missed.In southern Germany lies Lake Constance, which shares its shores between Germany, Austria and Switzerland. A 260-kilometer (161 mi) bike path leads around the lake past vineyards, idyllic towns and harbors. In the city of Konstanz, you can make a stop and stroll through the old town. Lake Constance is not only a center for bicycle tours, but also a starting point to cycle all the way to Berchtesgadener Land. Starting in Lindau, the Lake Constance-Königssee Cycle Path crosses 453 kilometers (281 mi) along the Bavarian Alps all the way to Lake Königssee in the Berchtesgaden National Park. Quiet and emerald green, it nestles between towering rock faces ― well worth visiting.The Altmühl Cycle Path starts in Rothenburg ob der Tauber, a small Bavarian town with medieval flair. Not far away is the source of the Altmühl River, which the bike path follows along its meandering course. It passes largely natural, wide meadows, juniper heaths, wooded hills and bizarre rocks. Picturesque towns and castles make the idyll perfect.From the source of the Rhine in Switzerland to its estuary in the North Sea near Rotterdam in the Netherlands, the EuroVelo 15 runs alongside one of the busiest waterways in the world. It extends over 1,230 kilometers (764 mi) past picturesque locations, such as the Rheinau harbor in Cologne (pictured).",Germany,germany news
217,2023-04-02,DW News,German tourism sector: Foreign staff face visa strains – DW – 03/29/2023,"Many hotels and restaurants in Germany are short on staff. Help could come from abroad, if only the administrative processes weren't so slow. From Cameroon to a small town in Bavaria: This journey was recently made by three young men who came to Eilsbrunn to participate in a training program to become cooks. They were hired by Muk Röhrl, owner of the Gaststätte Röhrl restaurant, a family business that's been in operation since 1658. ""German trainees are hard to find,"" he says. ""Nobody wants to work in the restaurant business anymore."" So Röhrl looked abroad, and found staff members in Africa.Although the staff members have now started their training in Germany, if all had gone according to plan, they would have started as early as September 2022.The application for their visas had been submitted to the respective German diplomatic mission in June 2022, but the documents weren't granted until February of this year.""When things go like this, of course you can't plan,"" says Röhrl. The unexpected delay was a problem for others involved, too. The owner of the apartments where the trainees were to be housed, for example, threatened to rent them out to others instead of waiting. Months of delays, as in this case, also leads to organizational problems for the vocational school doing the training.This is not an isolated case. Although the need for personnel in the hotel and catering industry in Germany could easily be filled by job seekers in , the gap in the labor force can only be reconciled sluggishly. ""A very important sticking point is the issuing of visas,"" says Sandra Warden, managing director of the German Hotel and Restaurant Association (DEHOGA).In some Balkan countries, for example, demand for visas exceeds the number of appointments offered by German diplomatic missions by a factor of 150. ""There are tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of people there who have already found an employer in Germany who wants to contract them, but they have no way to submit the appropriate visa application.""The German embassy in Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, is now cooperating with a private service provider to meet the high volume of applications. And because the ""very high demand,"" according to the embassy, ""far exceeds"" the available appointments, these are allocated monthly in a lottery — a practice that started in December 2021. The procedure is similar at the embassy in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Those who are unlucky are left out.""Of course, this is a particularly extreme example,"" Warden says of the situation in the aforementioned Balkan countries. ""But there are other areas of the world where the problem crops up, in India,  and Southeast Asia, for example."" At the core is a recurring pattern, says Warden. She says German authorities abroad simply don't see themselves as the agencies responsible for creating a welcome culture in Germany and for dealing with low-bureaucracy visa issuance: ""A defensive attitude prevails, like 'Oh God, they all want to come to us in Germany?!'""Although the  in the hotel and catering industry is not a new phenomenon, the situation has worsened dramatically since the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in the catering industry. Last year, the personnel deficit there was still 11.8%, according to a recent report published by the German Federal Statistical Office.Working conditions are very demanding, and many jobs in this area are ""mentally and physically grueling,"" Warden says. She notes, however, that some wage increases were in the double-digit percentage range last year. Still, her association expects many positions in the hospitality industry will remain unfilled this summer. The gaps could be filled by unskilled and skilled workers from abroad. If only the process to submit the appropriate paperwork wasn't so challenging.The German Federal Foreign Office confirms that it is aware of the difficulties. ""We have already addressed the problem of the sometimes long waiting and processing times for visas for skilled workers and employment visas,"" it said in response to a query by DW. ""In recent months, we have developed a visa expediting action plan within the Foreign Office, in which we have noted what measures would be necessary to remedy the situation.""The representative also added that the Foreign Office is currently dealing with all issues that are under its sole responsibility, including making application processes digital. The Foreign Office also referred to the revision of the , which is currently underway. The three political parties in Germany's governing coalition agreed to make it faster for visas to be issued and make the processes more digital. The law aims to make it  vocational, non-academic training from non-EU countries to migrate to Germany in order to work. For restaurateur Muk Röhrl from Eilsbrunn, however, it's not just about speed, but also about transparency. There is simply a lack of reliable information about the expected duration of the visa issuance process. It's difficult to reach embassies — inquiries by e-mail remained unanswered. ""It's not just that it  [the process] has to be faster,"" Röhrl says. ""It needs to follow a planned schedule. If I know it's going to take half a year, then yes, I can adjust to that.""",Germany,germany news
218,2023-04-02,DW News,Why Germany isn't attractive for foreign workers – DW – 03/09/2023,"Germany is trying to persuade more foreign skilled workers to stay in the country to help fill its job market. New studies suggest that Germany is becoming less attractive in international comparisons.Germany is becoming less attractive to top foreign talents, according to a new Bertelsmann/OECD study that will worry 's government, which is The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD)  released on Thursday, shows Germany slipped from 12th place in 2019 to 15th this year among the 38  countries. The analysis is based on seven ""dimensions"" that foreign talents are said to value: Quality of opportunities, income and tax, future prospects, family environment, skills environment, inclusiveness, and quality of life.The study isolated four groups of people that governments hope to attract — highly-qualified specialists, businesspeople, start-up founders, and international students — and found that in only one of those groups, the students, was Germany ranked in the top 10. The top four countries were New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland, and Australia, with the UK and the US in 7th and 8th place.To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that Mara knows more about the pluses and minuses of moving to Germany than most. Having previously lived in the UK, the 30-year-old Romanian was delighted to find a good job in advertising in Berlin. But after a year in Germany, she's already planning a way out. ""Maybe I'll stay another year or two, but I'm not planning long-term anymore,"" she told DW. ""I'll stay in Germany, but I don't see myself here for the next five or 10 years.""Getting a job was the easy part. She has since struggled with the bureaucracy, with finding an apartment in Berlin's notoriously difficult market, and with learning German. Loneliness has played a role too: Initially forced to work at home by the coronavirus pandemic, she has found it hard to make social contacts and, since her work is mostly in English, she hasn't been able to improve her German, despite taking courses in Bucharest.In contrast, Germany's bureaucracy for foreigners remains stubbornly in German, which hasn't made things easier. ""Of course, I can't ask people in Germany not to speak German. I would never do that,"" she said. ""But I personally felt quite strange when they asked me for different documents, and I didn't understand anything. A little more openness and flexibility would help. And when I ask if they speak English, they usually say 'no' very quickly and loudly.""And yet, Mara opted to move to Germany because she felt the country, and in her case specifically Berlin, had so much to offer. ""My first encounter with Berlin in 2015 was a great experience,"" she said. ""It is a good combination between the East and the West. It felt good.""To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that Germany is growing desperate to keep as many foreign skilled workers in the country, as a looming demographic shift is set to leave millions of jobs unfilled in the coming decade: The last of the ""baby boomer"" generation, which makes up a major part of the current workforce, is expected to retire by 2035.According to calculations by the Institute for Employment Research (IAB), part of Germany's Federal Employment Agency, the country needs a net balance of 400,000 immigrants to enter the country every year to fill the gaps in the labor market. The latest prognoses by Germany's official statistics office expects a net yearly immigration rate of 290,000 people — potentially leaving 3.6 million people missing in the job market.But persuading people to come to Germany is only one part of the solution, according to Paul Becker, a social scientist at the Berlin research institute Minor. ""For a successful skilled labor strategy, it will be crucial to ensure not only more immigration but also that fewer skilled workers emigrate again and instead remain in Germany with their families,"" he wrote in a new study released in February. Becker's research indicates that most people who come to Germany to work leave after only three or four years.Moving to a new country is always daunting, and Mara's experience of Berlin chimes in with a pre-study released last December by the Institute for Applied Economic Research (IAW), in Tübingen, southern Germany, which also highlighted issues like integration, dealing with authorities, paying taxes and social insurance.Based on a survey of 1,885 people who have left Germany, as well as 38 long interviews, the IAW study found a complex set of factors fed into why people left, ranging from residency permits, not being able to find suitable work, not being able to bring family over, the high cost of living, and personal issues.The most commonly given reason was simple enough: Legal issues associated with residency.""I'm assuming that in most cases those were residency permits for training or work and these simply expire and weren't extended,"" said IAW study author Bernhard Boockmann.Discrimination was also a factor, if only a relatively minor one. Though just over 5% of those questioned by the IAW named discrimination as a factor in their decision to leave, two-thirds of highly-qualified people from non-European countries said they had experienced discrimination either from authorities or at work.""Of course, we don't want to downplay the problem of discrimination, which is present in very diverse ways, is very problematic, and which needs to be addressed,"" said Boockmann. ""But it's only in rare cases that that's the reason why someone leaves Germany.""To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that Clearly, the government can only influence a few of the issues, and no single law or new measure is likely to persuade thousands of foreign workers to stay. But Mara, Becker, and Boockmann all think there is a concrete measure that could be taken.""The Federal Employment Agency (BA) doesn't have any concrete measures for how it should advise people who are thinking about emigrating again,"" said Boockmann. ""For example, we think that in a situation where someone loses their job, the BA should make targeted consultations.""Similarly, Boockmann thinks the government could do more to win back workers who have left Germany, as many of those he interviewed remained well-disposed to the country.Paul Becker thinks that families are a key factor and that the task goes way beyond labor policy. ""If skilled people come to Germany and bring their families, we have to ask: 'Ok, how can we make sure the family members get on well here',"" he told DW. ""Do they get an apartment easily; can they find a school place or a kindergarten place? Do they have the opportunity to learn the language? And how quickly are they consulted on issues related to the German labor market and receive the assistance they may need finding a job?""It is, said Becker, a matter of ""many little screws"" that have to be turned to create a good social framework.Mara, meanwhile, said one thing would have helped her: A way to make friends. ""Industry-specific programs for ex-pats should be supported more,"" she told DW. ""For me, it would have been very helpful to have a place where you can meet other professionals from abroad and exchange ideas.

219,2023-04-02,DW News,How German are the British royals? – DW – 03/29/2023,"As King Charles III makes his first state visit to Germany, DW takes a look at the British royals' German roots. There are more ties than you might think.About 300 years ago, on August 1, 1714, England's Queen Anne died. As a result, the German Elector George Louis of Hanover was proclaimed king of Great Britain in absentia. He was the only possible heir to the , and the first German to ascend an English throne.At the beginning, his British subjects were not amused. The German king did not set foot on English soil until two months after his proclamation and was crowned King George I on October 20, 1714. A divorced man, he publicly flirted with two mistresses. It was claimed that George hardly spoke any English — though some historians have disputed this, suspecting it was a ploy used in some ministerial meetings — and he had no manners. In fact, legend has it a protocol instruction for banquets asked for people not to hurl pieces of meat at the servants.However, the British people soon realized that George I did a great deal for the kingdom. By focusing on peace, stability and prosperity for his two states — Great Britain and Hanover — he contributed to establishing ""a new European balance of power that ended decades of war,"" according to Encyclopedia Virginia.His son George II left the British their , ""God Save The King,"" which later became ""God Save The Queen.""His grandson George III was the first in the line of German kings to be born in England, with English being his first language. He married the German Princess Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. The couple had 15 children.George III suffered from a metabolic disorder, his health deteriorated and he became mentally ill. This made the popular monarch, who supported the arts and sciences, increasingly incapable of ruling. He is mostly remembered as ""Mad King George.""His eldest son, foppish Georg August Friedrich, took over during his father's lifetime as prince regent in 1811 and was crowned King George IV in 1820 — the next king with a predominantly German bloodline.George IV's extravagant lifestyle did not endear him to his subjects, and the obese monarch was not mourned much when he died. His eccentricity managed to severely damage the reputation of the royal house. He left behind no particular political legacy, but a cultural one: Buckingham House was expanded into a palace and a building was erected in the seaside resort of Brighton that is still unique in Europe in terms of opulence — the Royal Pavilion.In 1837, George IV's niece Victoria, who also had a partly German bloodline, was crowned. She married her cousin, the German Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Initially, the British wondered why their queen would choose a provincial German prince, but they soon changed their minds.Albert allegedly initiated in England the German custom of putting up Christmas trees. He established the first World's Fair, in London in 1851, while also reforming administration and construction througout the kingdom.Thanks to the queen's consort, the British royal family regained its reputation. A magnificent statue of Albert stands in the center of London and Albert Bridge in London was named after him, as was the famous Royal Albert Hall concert hall.Meanwhile, Queen Victoria carried out representative functions in addition to her role as mother of nine children. Her influence in foreign policy was primarily grounded in her kinship relations with the leading ruling houses of Europe.She made sure her children married into other  — little wonder that today her descendants sit on the throne in many European royal houses, including Queen Margrethe of Denmark, Kings Harald V of Norway and Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden, the former Spanish royal couple Juan Carlos I and Sophia — all the way to Elizabeth II, the former British queen.Victoria was nicknamed the ""Grandmother of Europe"" and at the time, with 64 years on the throne, she was Britain's longest-serving monarch. The Victorian era, named after her, saw the growth of the British Empire to a global industrial power, as well as advances in the arts and sciences, along with societal changes.Some 120 years later, her length of rule was surpassed by her great-great-granddaughter, .Queen Victoria died in 1901, succeeded by her eldest son Edward VII, the first English king from the German dynasty of Sachsen-Coburg and Gotha. To make the name easier to pronounce for the English, the house was renamed Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Just a few years later, in 1910, his son George V became king. He was married to Maria von Teck, who also had German blood, and who became known as Queen Mary.The reign of George V coincided with , which was waged against his cousin, German Emperor Wilhelm II. In England, attitudes toward all things German changed — after all, the German Empire was seen as the main aggressor.In 1917, George V decided to change the German family name to Windsor. George also renounced all German titles, as did his cousin Ludwig von Battenberg, who renamed his family Mountbatten. Queen Elizabeth's husband, Prince Philip, came from this family.George's son Edward VIII became king in 1936. Less than a year later, he abdicated for love and married Wallis Simpson, an American divorcee. His brother Albert ascended the British throne as George VI.At the time, the Nazis and Adolf Hitler had long since gained a firm grip on Germany, with the world watching the Third Reich with interest and skepticism. Edward and Albert's mother, Queen Mary, insisted that her sons not forget their German roots — after all, they also had plenty of relatives in Hitler's Germany.For his part, Edward openly showed sympathy for the Nazis. One photo taken in 1937 shows the duke and his wife smiling and shaking hands with Just a few years ago, a video emerged showing Edward and his sister-in-law practicing the Hitler salute with two little girls — Margaret and Elizabeth, with the latter one day becoming the queen of England. The snippet was filmed by Elizabeth's father, King George VI.To this day, the British do not like to be reminded of the at times cordial relations of the British aristocracy with the German Nazis, trying as much as possible to keep evidence of such connections under wraps.The mother of Queen Elizabeth II was British, so she was only partly of German descent — even if she did display some stereotypical German virtues throughout her life, including discipline and a sense of duty.Her husband Philip, however, had predominantly German ancestors and spoke fluent German. In 1947, he became a British citizen and, shortly before his marriage to Elizabeth, relinquished his German title of nobility and called himself only ""Mountbatten."" Their eldest son, the new , has a bloodline made up of roughly half German ancestors.He and his first wife, the British Diana Spencer, had two sons: William and Harry. Prince William's wife, Catherine, has no German ancestors at all; Harry's wife, Meghan, is the daughter of an American with Irish roots and is .The person who is the last in line in the succession to the throne is actually a German. Hospital therapist Karin Vogel, who lives in Rostock, is a descendant of Sophia of Hanover, the mother of King George I, the first British king from Germany.But it's extremely unlikely that she would become queen of England one day: Nearly 5,000 people in the royal lineage would need to die before that can happen.",Germany,germany news
220,2023-04-02,DW News,The daily experience of Islamophobia in Germany – DW – 03/15/2023,"March 15 is the UN's International Day to Combat Islamophobia. Many of the 5.5 million Muslims in Germany say they experience discrimination every day.The sky over the eastern city of Erfurt was bright blue; the windy air was cold. The day, in early March, was a day of celebration for Suleman Malik. The new Ahmadiyya mosque in Erfurt-Marbach finally had a minaret. It towers 9 meters (30 feet) high. It is part of what will be the first new building of a Muslim place of worship on the territory of the former socialist .A crane was necessary to piece together the five round elements that make up the minaret. Every one of them weighs several tons and they had to be fitted together with utmost precision. Malik said it took months to contract a crane for such heavy lifting on such muddy ground. He said construction companies that were ready to do the job then backed out again, intimidated by racism, right-wing radicalism, and Islamophobia. The company that finally agreed to take it on, Malik said, contacted him at midnight before work was set to start, asking for cash payment, and insisting that no one film or photograph the building procedure. Malik is 34 years old. He has lived in Germany for 18 years. A Muslim born in Pakistan, he now speaks fluent German, works as a personnel consultant, and is the deputy mayor of the district of Erfurt-Rieth. But the building process for the small mosque in a small industrial park was hampered not only by the many building regulations. Malik has found pig carcasses that had been thrown onto the property. He said often cars drive by with their drivers shouting abuse out of the window. ""Protesters"" regularly gather on the other side of the street from the building site, for ""Catholic prayer services.""

He said Muslims in Germany were ""stigmatized."" The Central Council, he said, has asked the federal government several times to appoint a commissioner for Muslim life, just as there is a commissioner for Jewish life and a commissioner against antiziganism. ""There are very many commissioners, about 35, who fulfill very important functions,"" El Yazidi said. ""But this is being denied to Muslims, with hypocritical arguments."" He said people don't want to admit that there is a problem with anti-Muslim racism, ""and Muslims feel that.""Such officials exist in other countries and institutions.

The Cabinet has now approved a new legislative proposal from the Interior and Labor Ministries.Germany's dearth of  has forced Berlin to look hard at existing immigration policies, and the government's new plan designed to attract more with greater easek put forth jointly by the Interior and Labor Ministries cleared the Cabinet on Wednesday. It will still need to go through both houses of parliament.The new bill is part of a comprehensive  the ruling coalition says will modernize the country's immigration, residency and citizenship laws. Existing skilled labor immigration rules were established in March 2020, when Germany was governed by the so-called grand coalition headed by Angela Merkel.The draft law estimates that it could increase skilled labor migration from non-EU countries by around 60,000 per year, roughly doubling the pre-COVID pandemic figures of 2019. Changes include a lowering of various hurdles that have made it difficult for the country to , something Germany must do if it is to fill the historically high number of job openings in its labor market. Berlin said the number of vacant jobs reached 1.98 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, the highest ever recorded.To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that The bill was presented to the Cabinet by Labor Minister Hubertus Heil and Interior Minister Nancy Faeser.Asked to describe the nature of the changes to the immigration rules, Heil said there were ""three pillars"" to the new system. The first was to ensure ""that people with a qualification and a job offfer — including those who qualified on the job [not at university] — can come to Germany more easily,"" he told DW.  The next, he said, was that ""qualifications are important, but a qualification that applies in your native country plus a job offer should be enough"" to come to Germany, and then to square any issues with paper qualifications later. Famously, Germany is often reticent to recognize international qualifications, for instance university degrees, as comparable to its own.""And the third pillar is, we also want to give people the chance to seek work in Germany,"" Heil said. This third option would operate on a points-based system, with people scoring well in categories like work experience, qualifications, German language skills, age and ties to Germany being more likely to qualify for consideration. As before, those individuals who have a recognized diploma and a job contract will be given an EU Blue Card that will allow them to remain in the European Union for up to four years.

222,2023-04-02,DW News,Germany denies entry to foreign spouses – DW – 03/21/2023,"Love kept at a distance: German national Linda Wendt is fighting to establish a life in Germany with her husband. But he cannot move here without first passing a language test. A major problem — but not an isolated case.Linda Wendt and Moro Diop* are a couple. But they live their everyday lives 4,755 kilometers (2,955 miles) apart. That is the distance between Germany and Senegal. ""Long-distance love is extremely hard. I miss my wife constantly — morning, noon, and night,"" says Moro Diop.In 2020, Linda Wendt holidayed in Mbour, western Senegal, where Moro Diop lived. ""We saw each other and fell hopelessly in love,"" he said in a combined interview via Zoom.Linda, a student, then traveled to Senegal as often as she could. She did an internship and spent her semester breaks there. In 2022, the couple married in Moro's hometown of Mbour, celebrating with their families and many guests. is reaching a basic level of German language competency in listening, speaking, reading, and writing — called A1 on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages. Moro Diop speaks French and Wolof and has worked for years as a tradesman. In early 2022 he paused his work and spent several months at a German course run by the Goethe Institute in Senegal's capital Dakar.Wendt, who works and studies, paid for the language course, accommodation, learning materials, private lessons, and internet connection. Both cut costs on food to make ends meet. She calculates that learning German has already cost them about €6,000 ($6,430).Moro Diop has been studying German for 14 months, but he has failed the A1 test three times — with scores of 27, 37, and 40, his marks improve each time, but he has not yet reached the 60 points required to pass. The German exam is an extremely stressful situation for her husband, his wife reports.His father is sick, and Diop wants to support his parents and siblings. An uncle urges him to separate from his white wife, saying she is only taking advantage of him. But he keeps studying.The Goethe Institute describes the requirements of the A1 level: ""In the written exam you will hear short everyday conversations, private telephone messages or public announcements on a loudspeaker and complete exercises related to these... you will fill out simple forms and write a short personal essay about an everyday situation.""But if somebody does not live in Germany and knows nothing of everyday life there, it is not so easy for them to answer questions about it. In 2021, three-quarters of participants in Senegal failed the A1 language test at the Goethe Institute, the worst result among the 30 main countries of origin. In 2022, the failure rate was more than 50 %.

No language test means no visa. The German Foreign Office told DW that each year for the past few years, between 8,000 and 10,000 visa applications for spouse reunification have been rejected or withdrawn.In December, , but only for skilled personnel. Their spouses can come to Germany without a language test.Gülistan Yüksel is a member of the Bundestag with Germany's governing  party and campaigns for family reunification. She told parliament that the rules for spousal travel to Germany would be relaxed in the next legislative package: ""For years I have received letters from people who have been forced to live apart from their husbands or wives because of the language requirement — sometimes for many years. I believe nobody here in this room would want to experience that for themselves.""Swenja Gerhard, a lawyer and consultant for the Association of Binational Families and Partnerships confirms the plight of many couples: ""Some relationships break down, and some people break down, because of it."" The association is calling for the pre-entry language test to be scrapped.Linda Wendt has written a book about her experiences; its title translates to ""Between two worlds."" In the meantime, she has told her story to more than 20 federal lawmakers from the parties in Germany's coalition government: ""Both my husband and I are under enormous psychological stress because of this."" Several SPD and  lawmakers have answered sharing their commiserations and promised change.""But nothing has happened,"" Wendt said, disillusioned. Recently a lawmaker wrote to her saying that the bundle of laws which includes rewriting the rules on family reunification has been postponed until the second half of 2023.When it comes to the neoliberal , the third party in Germany's governing coalition, only Martin Gassner-Herz from the family committee answered. He referred to the need to prevent ""Forced marriages, marriages of convenience and arranged marriages"" as a reason for implementing the language test. The conservative Union parties, of the Christian Democrats (CDU) and Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU), had the same argument back in 2007 when the center-right CDU/CSU led the government under Chancellor Angela Merkel. The intention was that spouses who had moved to Germany should be able to communicate with authorities independently — without the help of their partners.The Bundesrat, the upper house of Germany's parliament which includes representatives from the 16 federal states, declared in 2015: Since no evidence could be found that the requirement for a language certificate before entry to Germany served to prevent forced marriages, ""this regulation should be repealed.""If Linda Wendt were a Greek or Romanian national, if she came from Brazil, El Salvador, or Korea, she could bring her to husband live with her without him passing the A1 language test.Spouses of citizens from EU member states and selected other countries are allowed to enter Germany without having to prove their German language competency beforehand. The same applies to spouses of recognized refugees, researchers, self-employed or highly qualified people, and, most recently, skilled professionals, even if neither of them speaks German.To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that The disadvantage to Germans is a form of ""domestic discrimination,"" lawyer Swenja Gerhard said. Because administrative law deals with individual cases, every couple must fight for family reunification themselves.""I am furious with the government,"" said Wendt. ""The institution of marriage is held up so highly in Germany, and then I am barred from living it."" Article 6 of the Basic Law, the German constitution, says ""Marriage and family are under the special protection of the state order."" Germans cannot be required compelled to live abroad because of it.In 2012 the judges of Germany's Federal Administrative Court decided that a spouse's proof of language competency should not be required before entering Germany to join their partner ""if, in individual cases, efforts to acquire the language are not possible, unreasonable, or unsuccessful within a year."" Reasons for this could be illness, disability, or a lack of language learning opportunities.The lawyer Gerhard reports that married couples often fail to prove such hardship cases.Diop is studying intensively for his fourth language test. Even if he does not pass, he wants to apply for a visa, citing the hardship clause. The visa application office of the German embassy in Dakar, in coordination with the immigration authorities in Germany, will decide the couple's future.",Germany,germany news

225,2023-04-02,DW News,Germany sees rise in crime among children – DW – 03/30/2023,"Germany's new crime stats show that there has been an increase in crime among children and young people. But experts are skeptical of lowering the age of criminal responsibility.The number of  committed by children in Germany has risen by a third in 2022 compared to the previous year, according to statistics released by the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) on Thursday.A total of 5.6 million crimes were registered in Germany in 2022 — . The figures also show an overall increase in crime of 3.5% when compared to 2019, the last year without COVID-19 restrictions. The number of suspects also has also risen by just over 10.7% to just over 2 million . The number of child suspects under the age of 14 has risen to 93,095 — a 35.5% increase on the previous year. Around 189,149 suspects were between the ages of 14 and 18 — in 2019 this figure was 177,082. The most frequent crime committed by children and young people is theft, followed by assault, damage to property and drug related crimes. ""Children are the most vulnerable in society. Protecting them is my top priority,"" Interior Minister Nancy Faeser, of the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), said on Thursday as she presented the statistics. She spoke of an ""appalling scale"" and of case numbers that have been rising for years.Holger Münch, president of the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA), was keen to stress that comparing the 2022 statistics with those of the two previous years was ""only conditionally"" helpful, due to the effects of the pandemic. Overall, the crime level last year was ""comparable"" to that of the last pre-COVID year, 2019, Münch argued.The release of the figures is likely to add fuel to an ongoing debate in Germany over whether to lower the age of criminal responsibility. Under German law, children reach the age of criminal responsibility at 14 — before which they cannot be prosecuted for committing a criminal offense. In some other countries, the age of criminal responsibility is lower: In England and Wales, the age of criminal responsibility is 10, while in France children can be sentenced at 13.The debate was reignited by the killing of  from the town of Freudenberg in North Rhine-Westphalia on March 11. Two girls aged 12 and 13 are suspected of carrying out the attack. The authorities say the autopsy found multiple knife wounds and that the victim bled to death. The two girls, who are said to have confessed to the crime, have since been taken into the care of the Youth Welfare Office.The crime statistics from other German states released earlier last week reflect an overall trend of rising crime among young people. In the southern state of Baden-Württemberg, for example, the number of child suspects went up by 33.4% on the previous year. A total of 10,490 children aged 13 and under were suspected of crimes in the south-western state in 2022.The figures prompted Baden-Württemberg's Interior Minister Thomas Strobl and Justice Minister Marion Gentges, both from the center-right Christian Democrats (CDU), to write a letter to their counterparts in the federal government calling for the age of criminal responsibility to be reviewed. In the letter, which referred to the Luise F. case, the ministers ask ""whether today the mental and moral maturity of young people begins earlier than it did in 1923"" when the law relating to the age of criminal responsibility was introduced.Calls to lower the age of criminal responsibility have also come from Rainer Wendt, the head of the German Police Union (DPolG). ""It's not about punishing children or sending them to jail, but about influencing their behavior, and criminal proceedings are very effective at doing that,"" Wendt told DW, adding that he believes children today mature much earlier than in previous decades."", they can monitor those orders, they can issue restraining orders and impose curfews,"" Wendt said. ""The Youth Welfare Office can't do any of that without the support of the parents, and, depending on the milieu in which the parents operate, there could be no cooperation at all.""But the consensus among psychologists, social workers, and criminologists is largely against lowering the age of criminal responsibility. ""I think [the debate] is completely inappropriate, unserious and unhelpful,"" Sibylle Winter, a child psychiatrist and senior consultant at Berlin's Charité hospital, told DW, adding that severe acts of violence such as the Luise F. killing were ""absolutely isolated incidents.""As far as the new statistics are concerned, Winter urges caution when it comes to identifying an overall trend showing more violence among children. In 2015, 79,371 crimes were committed by children under 14. That steadily declined until 2021 to reach 68,725. The number of crimes committed by 14 to 18-year-olds also fell from 218,025 cases in 2015 to 154,889 in 2021. ""I can imagine that it is a peak following the COVID-19 pandemic, because the pandemic increased the psychological stress on children and young people, violence in family homes increased, but it will probably calm down again,"" Winter said.The child psychiatrist also rejects the idea that children today are more mature than in previous decades. Although children under the age of 14 are assumed to know the difference between right and wrong in simple situations, the evidence from developmental psychology shows that the same does not apply to more complex situations. ""Cognitively they are definitely not more mature,"" she says. ""They are also definitely exposed to more risks through this whole social media situation that we have - they are online much more and are confronted with content that they can't process properly.""Winter argues that whether or not there are existing psychological issues, a range of effective measures can be applied independently of the criminal justice system.""Anyone who commits such a one-time act of serious violence must face some consequences, and these are also available within the framework of the youth welfare system and family court proceedings,"" Winter concluded.Torsten Verrel, the head of the Department of Criminology at the University of Bonn, is also against lowering the age of criminal responsibility. He says that the debate always reignites in aftermath of rare but extreme cases of child delinquency. ""There's a nice adage from the US that says: hard cases make bad law,"" Verrel told DW, adding that the idea that lowering the age of criminal responsibility would be an effective deterrent for children is simply naive.""Child crime usually takes the form of shoplifting and damage to property, all that would come within the scope of criminal law and nobody wants that,"" he says. ""Thankfully our political system is stable and sensitive enough to realize that this is a very populist demand that would lead to huge problems in practice.""The evidence from countries such as the US, England and Wales shows that lowering the age of criminal responsibility does not prevent children from committing crimes, says Friedrich Lösel, former director of the Cambridge Institute of Criminology and now a professor of psychology at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg.""The key issue is that are no clear age thresholds in development. In fact, some are advocating that the threshold should now go up until early adulthood because the brain is not yet fully developed before 28 or so,"" Lösel told DW. ""I think we must really protect these young people as far as possible, but we should not only see them as victims,"" he added. ""They have intentionally carried out a serious offense and we need very intensive rehabilitative measures, in some cases in secure units."" ",Law and Justice,politics news
226,2023-04-02,DW News,Berlin clarifies gender equality rules for topless bathing – DW – 03/28/2023,"Topless bathing was never officially banned in the German capital, but now the city's municipal pool operator has said all genders must be treated equally when it comes to appropriate attire.When Lotte Mies went topless at an indoor swimming pool in the  district of Kaulsdorf last December, she was asked to either cover her chest or leave the pool. The 33-year-old activist had already called ahead to check with staff that she could go topless and was told it would not be a problem. But when she refused to cover up, the police were called and Mies was forced to leave. ""It was more than humiliating for me that day and it really wasn't nice to be treated like a second-class citizen on the  and not to be able to decide for myself how to [present] my own body,"" Mies told DW. ""I thought about it and I came to the conclusion that: 'No, I don't want to ashamed of my breasts anymore, it's actually not in order,'"" Mies told DW. ""This permanent sexualization that we are exposed to, and it's not just about breasts, I just don't want to accept it anymore.""Mies filed a complaint with the ombudsman's office responsible for compliance with Berlin's Anti-Discrimination Act, a law that was introduced in the state of Berlin in June 2020 and is the first of its kind in Germany. The General Equal Treatment Act, which covers the whole of Germany, forbids discrimination in labor and civil law contexts. Berlin's Anti-Discrimination Act extends this existing law to guard against discrimination in the public sector.The Berliner Bäderbetriebe, the capital's municipal swimming pool operator, never had a gender-specific dress code, only a general rule mandating ""customary bathing attire"" for both men and women which left it down to staff at each pool to interpret what this actually meant. Now, in response to the public outcry over Mies' case, the pool operator has issued a clarification to ensure that women can go topless at public pools just the same as men. The clarification simply states that: ""Swimming 'topless' is equally permissible for all persons"" and only the ""primary sexual organs"" need to covered. The German government's  classifies breasts, beards and body hair as ""secondary sex characteristics."" Primary sex characteristics are defined as those necessary for sexual reproduction, such as the penis, testicles and vagina.Doris Liebscher, the head of the ombudsman's office responsible for compliance with the Anti-Discrimination Act in Berlin, welcomed the clarification to the rules in the capital, saying the decision ""establishes equal rights for all Berliners, whether male, female or nonbinary.""This all comes after a similar case hit the headlines in the summer of 2021, when Gabrielle Lebreton went topless at a water park with her 5-year-old son in the Berlin district of Treptow-Köpenick. When Lebreton refused to cover her chest, the police were called and she was forced to leave the park.Lebreton decided to sue, in one of the first cases to be launched off the back of Berlin's Anti-Discrimination Act. She lost her case, with the district court (Landesgericht) ruling that women's breasts are different to men's and can therefore by subject to different regulations. Lebreton is currently in the process of appealing the decision at the Berlin Appellate Court (Kammergericht).""Unfortunately, this idea is exactly where the discrimination of the female chest starts,"" Leonie Thum, the lawyer representing Lebreton, told DW. ""The assumption that the sexualization of the female chest is somehow rooted in biology and therefore somehow mandatory, which isn't true. It's simply to overcome a social assumption that the law doesn't define as an adequate justification for discrimination of genders.""Thum argued that the ruling essentially subverted what the anti-discrimination law is for, as if ""part of the public has an issue with something, that is always enough reason to justify discrimination.""After Lebreton was ordered to leave the water park in 2021, activists in Berlin founded the intersectional feminist alliance Equal Breasts for All (""Gleiche Brust für Alle"") which campaigns for the desexualization of the upper body in a similar vein to the Free the Nipple campaign in the US.Under the motto ""No nipple is free until all nipples are free,"" campaigners cycled topless through Berlin to protest the hypocrisy of denying women the right to go topless in a city covered with adverts depicting ""half-naked, sexualized and unrealistic images of bodies."" The Free the Nipple campaign went mainstream in 2013 after the release of the film of the same name. Using the hashtag #freethenipple, campaigners have argued that women should be allowed to appear topless in public in the same way as men, including on social media platforms, where images of women's breasts are regularly censored — from Renaissance paintings to photos of breastfeeding.""Men don't have to hide their beards just because in puberty that signifies that they are ready to have sex, but for some reason with women's breasts that's the case,"" said Thum, adding that men have biological markers that signal puberty in the same way women do. The only difference, she said, is that they are not expected to hide them.Another often overlooked aspect of the rules around topless bathing is the rights of transgender and nonbinary people, said Thum. ""If you have a gender regulation based on two genders, that is binary, then you will always discriminate against trans and nonbinary people. There's no way around it and that's what happens all the time."" In August 2021, a nonbinary topless swimmer was ordered to leave a public swimming pool in the German city of Göttingen in Lower Saxony. Following a campaign by Equal Breasts for All, the municipal authority last year introduced a pilot project to allow topless bathing for all genders on Saturdays and Sundays at four of its pools.Germany is . Fully naked bathers can be seen on beaches and in parks soaking up the sun, even in the most conservative parts of the country. In fact, the country has a long tradition of nude public bathing as part of the ""free body culture"" (""Freikörperkultur,"" commonly referred to as FKK), a naturist movement that emerged in the late 19th century.In an interview with Playboy in 2017, prominent Left Party politician Gregor Gysi, from the former East Germany, complained about the decline of ""free body culture,"" which he blamed on the ""pornographic gaze"" of men from the West.Since Berlin's municipal pool operator announced it would clarify its rules concerning topless bathing as a result of Lotte Mies' compliant, Mies has been subjected to a wave of misogynistic online abuse, ranging from derogatory comments about her appearance to rape threats. ""Most of them are the classic victim-perpetrator role reversal, that I am somehow to blame if more [women] are raped now,"" Mies told DW.Germany still lags behind other European countries when it comes to implementing anti-discrimination legislation long since enshrined in EU law, said Thum.""I always thought it would be a straightforward process, that it would always develop to a more equal, free society and I think we are, but because of a lot of pushback it's much slower than you would think,"" she said.To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that ",Germany,germany news
227,2023-04-02,DW News,Germany walks fine line on nuclear weapons – DW – 03/24/2023,"Germany is not a nuclear power, but it is part of US nuclear strategy. In light of the war in Ukraine and the undoing of Cold War-era arms control, the country's balanced approach is coming under more pressure.If the Cold War had gone nuclear, it would have likely begun on German soil. Geographically, Germany sat between the United States and its NATO allies on one side, and the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact countries on the other. Politically, the country was split between West and East. Strategically, that was where the US and Soviet militaries faced off — on either side of the Iron Curtain.Germany was therefore a nuclear tripwire between the enemy superpowers, and the country both benefits from the supposed safety of the US nuclear umbrella, and still faces the direct risk of nuclear escalation. Former West Germany has been home to a strong pacifist movement, while many in former East Germany hold a less hostile view of Russia.These factors help make the issue of arms control a particularly sensitive one in Germany.""Germany remains clearly committed to its engagement in arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation, even given the changed conditions,"" an official from the German Federal Foreign Office told DW.That is a reference to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which some military analysts fear could lead President Vladimir Putin to break the  if his conventional forces continue to struggle on the battlefield.""The federal government, with its partners, unequivocally opposes any softening of the taboo,"" the German government official added, referring to an unwritten understanding not to use nuclear weapons ever since the US did twice against Japan, ending the Second World War in 1945.Germany's opposition to nuclear weapons competes with the expectation that it supports the security status quo. NATO nuclear sharing — the US-led military alliance's long-standing policy that permits the stationing of US nuclear weapons on non-US territory — means German warplanes could carry them in the event of nuclear war.As many as 20 such warheads remain at the Büchel Air Base in western Germany, according to an estimate by the Nuclear Threat Initiative. The think tank, based in Washington, DC, counted some 130 others at the Ramstein Air Base, until they were removed between 2001 and 2005.The nuclear balancing act adds tension both to German domestic politics as well as to the Euro-Atlantic alliance. Any disagreement, however, has taken a back seat after .Some politicians in the Green Party, traditionally one of Germany's more fierce critics of nuclear weapons, have also been among the country's most vocal supporters of Ukraine. NATO officials, meanwhile, take every opportunity to show that Russia's efforts to divide the alliance have failed.""Clearly, we are at something of an inflection point,"" John Erath, Senior Policy Director for the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, told DW. ""One of the means Russia has chosen to accomplish its end is to make threats of the use of nuclear weapons.""That end — taking control of Ukraine, and breaking US and NATO support — has so far not come to pass. However, using nuclear weapons as a ""diplomatic tool,"" Erath said, has been somewhat effective at moderating that support. The US has been careful to avoid escalation that could draw it into direct conflict with Russia, and German officials have often expressed their concern about crossing a line that would make Germany an official party to the war.""The real danger lies in if this conflict concludes with Russia perceived as succeeding, and this tool being perceived as being effective. Because that opens the floodgates,"" Erath said. Other nuclear-armed states, such as North Korea, could make bolder threats with their own arsenals.Such nuclear diplomacy has precedent. In the 1980s, new deployments of Soviet nuclear forces prompted NATO to respond in kind. Widespread protests, especially in then-West Germany, pressured the government to oppose the stationing of more US missiles on its soil.By NATO's own account, it was a ""difficult period for West Germany as well as NATO."" The alliance, however, held. A ""double-track"" compromise was reached, which saw more deployments, but also negotiations to reach a deal with the Soviet Union on arms control.""Differences in nuclear risk tolerance among NATO allies can be a pressure point for Russia to exploit,"" Jonas Schneider, an international security associate at the Berlin-based security think tank SWP, told DW. ""Overall, Germany has staked out a more cautious positioning when it comes to nuclear risk.""To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that Arms control in terms of treaties is at its nadir, now that Russia has suspended — but not withdrawn from — New , the last major agreement limiting Russian and US nuclear systems. In the near term, at least, security analysts like Schneider are relatively sanguine. ""In all, I don't see an increase in the nuclear risk as a result of what's happened to New START,"" he said.That is partly because treaties are just one element of arms control. Transparency, dialogue, and data collection through both public and clandestine means are others. Nuclear weapons are expensive and conspicuous, making changes in numbers or deployment fairly easy to spot.The treaties have also only covered Russian and US forces. While they control about 90% of the world's nuclear weapons, including first-strike capability, the absence of China from these treaties is a bigger worry.There are several small and midsize nuclear-armed states, but Erath said it is China ""where things are changing in the nuclear world."" Moreover, the US lacks the awareness and lines of communication of the kind built up with Russia over decades.""If there were to be a crisis over Taiwan, it's a little bit harder to get that direct line to Beijing,"" he said.Most countries do not possess nuclear weapons, and 92 of them have signed the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Without any of the world's nuclear powers on board, however, the agreement is largely symbolic.Germany, which supports the abolition movement but is beholden to US nuclear doctrine, finds itself trying to do two things at once. Germany attended a treaty meeting in 2022 in Vienna as an observer — a reflection of anti-nuclear aspirations competing with real-world nuclear commitments. ",Politics,politics news
228,2023-04-02,DW News,IOC faces anger over Russian and Belarusian athletes ruling – DW – 03/31/2023,"News that the IOC will allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete in international competitions has caused a backlash from athletes around the world. Many of them are vowing to fight back against the decision.The  to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to participate in international competitions was met with a mix of shock and anger during a conference call this week.Athletes from the two nations were  in February 2022 after Russia's invasion of Ukraine and following the IOC executive board's recommendation.Dozens of athletes and Olympians immediately railed against the decision, including two-time Ukrainian Olympic skeleton competitor Vladislav Heraskevych, who labelled the recommendations as ""absolutely wrong"".""The war originally started in 2014, when Russia "", said the 20-year-old from Kyiv. ""They occupied our territories and the Olympics helped to increase Russia's image on a high level. It was completely wrong to state that sports is outside of politics then, and it is also wrong to say that now.""According to Heraskevych, the Ukrainian National Olympic Committee Athletes' Commission only heard from the IOC last week, having heard nothing from them for almost a year.""The Russians use sports as a progaganda tool to brainwash and encourage more Russian people to participate in the war and commit genocide against Ukrainians"", said Heraskevych. ""They have no place in international sports.""On Tuesday,  outlined new guidelines that would allow Russian and Belarusian athletes , paving the way for their return.A host of athletes from all over the world have criticized Bach's claim that the inclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes has already been shown to work in other sports and competitions, such as tennis.The tennis governing bodies  have allowed for players from those two countries to compete under a neutral flag since March 2022, stating that ""the players compete as individuals to earn their place in tournaments based on their rankings"".As an example, Bach identified Ukrainian player Marta Kostyuk's ATX Open final against Varvara Gracheva from Russia. Kostyuk didn't boycott the game, but refused to shake Gracheva's hand after winning her first WTA title. ""We have a ranking system in our sport. If I don't participate I will lose my ranking and my career will be over,"" said Kostyuk, who also refused to shake hands with Russia's Anastasia Potava at the Miami Open a week ago.""A lot has been said and I wanted to say from myself, we have not been doing it publicly, but for the last year we have been fighting to exclude Russians and Belarusians from our sport,"" she added at the conference. ""Unfortunately we are not independent players. We are working for the WTA and ATP, and we do not have a lot of power to make changes.""Fellow Ukrainian tennis player Lesia Tsurenko concurred with Kostyuk's view.""Everything that Bach says is a clear manipulation,"" said Tsurenko, who also didn't hold back towards the tennis governing bodies. ""The ATP and WTA are protecting the Russian athletes all the time and they don't care about how the Ukrainian ones must feel. They are also trying to prevent any kind of action from Ukrainian players.""Like many other Ukrainian athletes, Tsurenko is left to grapple with the consequences of the IOC's decision. ""It is an ethical conflict,"" she said in the Wednesday conference of the possibility of being forced to compete against a Russian athlete. ""I had panic attacks.""German fencer Lea Krüger found herself in a similar situation when she noticed that the  had voted to overturn a ban on Russian and Belarusian fencers competing in its events.""It was portrayed as if we, the athletes, took the decision that the Russians can come back to fencing,"" Krüger said during the conference. ""But it was the federation that took that decision and we have to deal with the consequences as athletes.""Earlier this week, more than 300 active and former fencers wrote to the IOC urging the organization to uphold sanctions against Russian and Belarusian athletes, saying that allowing them entry back into international competitions would be ""a catastrophic error"".""They put the interests of Russia and Belarus before the ones of the athletes, especially the Ukrainians,"" said Krüger. ""We had to show the world that not all fencing athletes agree with this, that's why we wrote that letter.""Fellow fencer Olga Kharlan from Ukraine found the FIE's decision ""very tough mentally and physically"" and says it is hard to process that the IOC is going down a similar path.""It looked like they were on the Russian side, there wasn't a single word of solidarity with the Ukrainian athletes and people, which was quiet unbelievable.""Meanwhile, Ukraine's sports minister said in January that the country would consider boycotting the Olympics if Russian and Belarusian athletes are allowed to compete at Paris 2024. When asked this question, Vladislav Heraskevych didn't rule out taking collective legal action against IOC, should they stand by their decision.""We are not ready to make a big announcement, but we are looking at all of our options.""Whilst Heraskevych doesn't see a boycott as the solution for the situation, he paints a grim picture of the future, should Russian and Belarusian athletes be allowed to compete in upcoming competitions.""We were trying to build bridges for eight years and it lead to a full invasion"", he said. ""I am really scared what it will mean for the future if we have to compete with Russian athletes. Maybe it will lead to World War 3, you never know, especially with Russia.""",Sports,science news
229,2023-04-02,DW News,Sky,"High-altitude winds remain a huge untapped source of renewable energy, but a race to the sky is well underway.For a child, the simple act of flying a kite can be exhilarating; running and pulling at the line to send it ever higher into the sky where the winds dance to their own wild tune. Those same winds that captivate young imaginations are also working their magic on a growing body of researchers intent on harvesting what are known as high-altitude . At a height of 200 meters (656 feet) and more, winds tend to blow stronger and more steadily than those closer to the ground. These winds are so strong, in fact, that they could be used to generate more electricity than we need and significantly more than  on land can produce. A doubling of wind speed can theoretically generate up to eight times more power.Moritz Diehl, who heads the Department of Microsystems Engineering at the University of Freiburg, said harvesting high-altitude winds is one of the ""most promising"" technologies for generating  in the future.""You see all the sky above conventional turbines, and you think all this  is just blowing there and it's not used,"" he said.Stephan Wrage, CEO of the German wind power company SkySails-Power, wants to change that and make the ""largest yet untapped source of renewable energy worldwide"" suitable for mass use.And he's not the only one. For years, engineers, various startups and international companies have been in a race to bring high-altitude winds down to Earth at low cost. Many have failed in their attempts and some have gone bankrupt. But others are on the verge of bringing their flying power plants to the market.One of the first projects to attract attention was launched by the US energy company Altaeros in 2010. Their prototype was a generator attached to a helium balloon — in other words, a wind turbine without a heavy base and tower.Tested in Alaska, it was connected to the ground by a cable. According to the company, it produced energy for about 50 households at an altitude of 600 meters. Around the same time, the German company SkySails developed a high-altitude kite to pull entire container ships. The idea was to  used to run the engine, by up to 10%. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that Although the test with the kite worked, the shipping company went bankrupt and neither the kite nor the helium wind turbine conquered the market. But both prototypes pointed to one thing: harvesting high-altitude winds requires flying power plants.Enter . In 2013, the tech giant bought the US airborne wind energy company Makani for an undisclosed amount, triggering euphoria in the niche sector. Their flying power plant, a device about the size of a small aircraft, climbed to an altitude of around 300 meters where it circled in a continuous and automated loop.The high speeds propelled small wind wheels on the wings, which generated electricity. At the time, Moritz Diehl thought it sounded ""crazy"" — but it worked. A single flying power plant made enough energy for 300 households, according to Makani. It seemed to be the breakthrough everyone had been waiting for, until a device crashed into the sea during a test mission. Google's parent company Alphabet subsequently dropped the project, expressing doubts about the economic viability of the flying power-drone.The end of Makani didn't spell the end of airborne wind energy. A new wave of startups has kept working on increasingly small devices that use ever less material. Some have pursued Makani's approach, while others have attached their drone to a rope which tugs at a generator. Still others took the same approach but replaced the drone with a kite.Among them is SkySails-Power — successor to the bankrupt German company behind the towing kites. Now specializing in energy generation, it has come up with a device that uses a ""pumping cycle"" to . The kite takes off automatically, directs itself against the wind and unwinds a rope from a generator. It flies in a figure eight, constantly tugging at the rope and creating energy.The kite is designed to remain airborne for hours, days and weeks. In bad weather or in dangerous conditions, it triggers an alarm and can be recovered. Though the sector still requires considerable investment and clarification of many regulatory questions around air traffic, Wrage said the technology could help the 1.4 billion people globally who live off-grid, and often use dirty diesel generators to power their homes.According to a study by members of the wind industry itself, airborne wind energy could become significantly cheaper than diesel — and even cheaper than traditional wind energy. SkySails-Power, currently leader in the sector, has sold a first unit to Mauritius. The company is looking to build a high-altitude wind hub in East Africa and operate offshore kite wind farms.SkySails said a single one of its kites can create energy for up to 500 households, using 90% less material than traditional wind turbines. Other advantages include flexibility of location.""You could also operate them above the forest. You could stop them operating and or even land if there's a swarm of birds passing by,"" said Diehl.Rishikesh Joshi, an aerospace engineering researcher at the Delft University of Technology, said ""it will still take a few years"" before the technology makes a difference. ""The wind industry also took around 40 years to develop to be this cheap,"" he said.In the meantime, traditional turbines continue to turn. And even when the airborne wind energy sector is more advanced, the idea is not to replace  but to make greater use of the winds that blow high above the ground.To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that ",Climate,environment news
230,2023-04-02,DW News,Europe's most beautiful clocks – DW – 03/24/2023,"Europe's most famous clock tower stands in London. Known affectionately as Big Ben, the tower is officially called Elizabeth Tower. Big Ben correctly refers to only the largest and heaviest of the five bells. The ""Voice of Britain"" tune played by the bells usually chimes every hour. The Astronomical Clock at Prague's town hall dates from 1410 and is a masterpiece of Gothic technology. Legend says that city authorities burned out clockmaker Mikuláš of Kadaň's eyes so he couldn't make similarly spectacular clocks for other countries, as he was being requested. Whether fact or fiction, it's certainly unique. The 12 apostles delight visitors with their puppet play.The World Time Clock on Alexanderplatz is a more recent model. It was designed in East Germany by industrial designer Erich John and was presented to the public in 1969. Since then, it has become a popular meeting place for Berliners and tourists alike. At the top is a simplified model of our solar system, and the cylinder below shows the time in each of Earth's 24 time zones.A less well-known but all the more interesting clock is located in Berlin's Europa-Center shopping mall. The 13-meter (43-foot) high chronometer from 1982 covers three floors. Here you can watch the flow of time. The level of green liquid in the large spheres on the left shows the hours, while the small spheres on the right count the minutes.When it comes to clocks, Switzerland is a hot destination. The Zytglogge, the clock tower from 1530, is the landmark of the capital, Bern. On the hour, tourists can always watch the figures depicting the golden hour.This  Renaissance masterpiece in the Strasbourg Cathedral was also built by Swiss clockmakers. The apostles and the four ages, personified as children, juveniles, adults and the elderly, start moving every day at 12:30 p.m. They all pass by a figure representing death.Cuckoo clocks, alongside red Bollenhut bobble hats and cherry and chocolate gateau, are the symbols of the Black Forest in southwestern Germany. So it's no wonder that the world's largest cuckoo clock can be found here in Triberg. The movement alone weighs 6 tons. The cuckoo is impressive — at the full and half hour, the 4.5-meter (14-foot) wooden bird calls from its window on the first floor.Two or three times a day, the glockenspiel figures make their big appearance at Munich City Hall. The life-size figures depict two events from Munich's city history: The wedding of Duke Wilhelm V. in 1568 and the coopers' dance, depicting their defiance after a devastating plague epidemic. While it may be historic, the glockenspiel is operated in a very modern way — with solar energy.Designed by the Art Nouveau painter Franz Matsch, Vienna's best-known clock adorns a small bridge on the Hoher Markt square. In the course of 12 hours, 12 copper figures from Vienna's history cross the bridge. At noon, all the figures hold a musical parade, among them Empress Maria Theresa and composer Joseph Haydn. During Advent, there are Christmas carols at 5 p.m. and 6 p.m.In Austria, the Clock Tower of Graz, located on the Schlossberg, is visible from afar. Its special feature is that the hour and minute hands are reversed. Originally, there was only one large hand for the hours so that it could be seen from a distance. Later, the small minute hand was added.The astronomical clock on St. Mark's Square displays not just the time but also the current zodiac sign as well as the phases of the moon and the sun. Until the last restoration in 1998, the ""Temperatore,"" the tower guard, lived in the tower with his family. Since 2006, the clock has been monitored digitally.Although it's not exactly a real clock, the dragon heads in the central French city of Blois still keep time. Every half hour they appear at the windows and move in a terrifying way. Behind the facade is a museum that provides a glimpse into the history of magic since the father of modern magic, Jean Eugene Robert-Houdin, was born in Blois.",Europe,france news

The coordinated effort is an attempt to make up for lost Russian gas and use infrastructure more efficiently. Shoppers have long bought in bulk. It is a way to stock up and save money. Now countries in the European Union (EU) are using this simple idea and working together to purchase much needed natural gas for the continent. The bloc hopes the ambitious move will help it make up for the loss of Russian gas and guarantee a new stable supply while keeping energy prices down. It is an unprecedented step for the EU and its latest attempt for .To implement this strategy,  created an IT platform called EU Energy Platform that facilitates purchases of joint gas,  (LNG) and hydrogen across the continent. The idea for a common purchasing mechanism was established shortly after the invasion of Ukraine, in April 2022, and covers the bloc's 27 countries plus three neighboring countries. Following a steering board meeting of the platform earlier this month, EU Commission Vice-President Maros Sefcovic told reporters that 22 member states so far have expressed their preliminary interest in aggregating a gas demand equaling more than 17 billion cubic metres of gas over the next three years.""I encouraged the remaining five member states to notify their volumes as soon as possible,"" he said, adding that service provider PRISMA will go live with its AggregateEU tool on March 15. ""The service provider will help us implement demand aggregation as a first step towards the joint purchase of gas,"" he said. Companies may then voluntarily conclude purchase contracts with suppliers ""either individually or jointly.""Luckily for the EU, a number of  have already started transporting gas, or will start soon. Additionally,  are being built along the continent's coasts. Energy experts fear, though, that significant additional supplies will not reach the market until 2024. That means what is available will be fought for, possibly turning European allies into competitors for supplies. announces it ""will play a key role in pooling demand, coordinating infrastructure use, negotiating with international partners and preparing for joint gas and hydrogen purchases.""    To give the platform more weight, EU countries are required to pool at least 15% of their gas reserve obligations. So a minimum amount of business is guaranteed. Then the procurement platform will match sellers and buyers. By pooling demand and leveraging the bloc's big purchasing power, the EU hopes to get the best prices and keep supplies flowing. The increased transparency should especially benefit smaller landlocked countries that could otherwise be left behind.""The coordination mechanism will ensure a better pricing mechanism, because all the demand will be taken into consideration to establish the total volume for tender and matched to the supply,"" said Anna Grosman, a reader in innovation and entrepreneurship at Loughborough University London. To better meet local gas needs, smaller regional groups within Europe will have their own additional coordination mechanisms, she told DW.Besides meeting the gas needs of entire countries, the platform will also be open to businesses like big industrial gas users in the steel, aluminum, ceramics, glass and vehicle production industries. They can buy gas individually or through larger consortia groups to keep their factories going.To keep things efficient, the EU will implement a central buyer scheme, ""under which one gas company will negotiate, on behalf of smaller gas companies and gas consumers, a contract with suppliers for the aggregated demand,"" said Maros Sefcovic. ""We aim to have a number of central buyers, representing different groups of companies, to encourage competition, to the ultimate benefit of European consumers.""The EU is one of the biggest gas consumers in the world. The platform is supposed to help it better leverage its current gas infrastructure more efficiently. It will also assist in the coordination of LNG imports, gas storage and building up more infrastructure. In the runup to this past winter, many feared that a few cold months could deplete Europe's gas reserves. But it was a  and between August 2022 and January 2023, the EU reduced gas consumption by over 19%, according to figures from Eurostat that compared average consumption for the same months between 2017 and 2022.Now that Europe has made it through its first winter after the invasion of Ukraine with its reserves quite full, attention is focusing on the future. For the EU the most immediate concern is topping up reserves for the winter 2023-2024.To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that Despite dampened demand in 2022 and current high reserves, the numbers are staggering. Last year baseline demand for gas in the EU came in at 360 billion cubic meters. This year the  sees the need for around 395 billion cubic meters of gas, nearly as much as 2021.Yet in the end, Anna Grosman doesn't think the platform will guarantee supply. What it will do is improve the price and options for buyers. ""But this depends on how well the governance mechanism would function, and whether some members end up having more power than others,"" she said. Industry not private consumers will likely profit the most from the joint gas purchasing project.So far, over 50 companies from around the globe have shown interest in using the platform according to Maros Sefcovic. A lot hangs in the balance. If Europe wants to stay warm and keep its businesses competitive industrial-sized solutions are needed, and the EU has to deliver what it promises.",Business,business news
236,2023-04-02,DW News,A new world order? BRICS nations offer alternative to West – DW – 03/27/2023,"Predictions about the BRICS countries as the fastest growing economies haven't quite panned out. Instead, the alliance is now offering a diplomatic forum and development financing, outside of the Western mainstream.The acronym began as a somewhat optimistic term to describe what were the world's fastest-growing economies at the time. But now the BRICS nations — , Russia, India, , South Africa — are setting themselves up as  to existing international financial and political forums.""The  of the emerging economies has faded,"" confirmed Günther Maihold, deputy director of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, or SWP. ""The BRICS countries are experiencing their geopolitical moment.""Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa are trying to position themselves as representatives of the Global South, providing ""an alternative model to the G7.""The G7 is an ""informal forum"" of heads of state of the world's most advanced economies, founded in 1975. Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Japan, Canada and the US are members, as is the EU.The acronym BRIC, which initially stood for Brazil, Russia, India and China, was coined by Jim O'Neill in 2001 when he was chief economist of the multinational investment bank, Goldman Sachs. At the time, the four countries had sustained rates of high economic growth and the BRIC label stood for economic optimism about the future of those nations. Opponents of the label said the countries were too diverse to be grouped together like this and that it was really just a Goldman Sachs marketing ploy.But what may have started as a marketing ploy to encourage investors has grown into  similar to the G7. In 2009, the four nations met for their first summit in Russia's Yekaterinburg. In 2010, South Africa was invited to join the group, adding the ""S"" to BRICS.In 2014, with $50 billion (around €46 billion) in seed money, the BRICS nations launched the New Development Bank as an alternative to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. In addition, they created a liquidity mechanism called the Contingent Reserve Arrangement to support members struggling with payments.These offers were not only attractive to the BRICS nations themselves, but also to many other developing and emerging economies that had had painful experiences with the IMF's structural adjustment programs and austerity measures. This is why many countries said they might be interested in joining the BRICS group.The BRICS bank is open to new members. In 2021, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Uruguay and Bangladesh took up shares. However, these were much lower than the respective $10 billion investments made by the bank's founding members.South African Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor has said worldwide interest in the BRICS group was ""huge."" In early March,  that she had 12 letters from interested countries on her desk.""Saudi Arabia is one,"" she said. ""United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Algeria, and Argentina,""  as well as Mexico and Nigeria.""Once we've shaped the criteria [for lending], we will then make the decision,"" she said, noting that the topic would be placed on the agenda for the upcoming August summit in South Africa.The most recent economic developments in BRICS member states have little to do with the initial myths upon which the group was founded. Of the five members, only China has achieved sustained and extensive growth since then. As China's gross domestic product grew from $6 trillion in 2010 to nearly $18 trillion in 2021, the economies in Brazil, South Africa and Russia stagnated. India's GDP grew from $1.7 trillion to $3.1 trillion, but was outpaced by China's growth.Since the start of the Russian war in Ukraine, the BRICS countries have only distanced themselves further from the so-called West. Neither , Brazil,  or China are taking part in sanctions against Russia. This has become increasingly clear with near-historic levels of trade between India and Russia, or in Brazil's dependence on Russian fertilizer.""Diplomatically, the war in Ukraine appears to have drawn a stark dividing line between an eastern-backed Russia and the West,"" political scientist Matthew Bishop from the University of Sheffield  late last year. ""Consequently, some European and US policymakers worry that the BRICS may become less an economic club of rising powers seeking to influence global growth and development, and more a political one defined by their authoritarian nationalism.""To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that Maihold of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs agrees. He said the BRICS alliance is not so much a counter to the West but more a forum for increased sovereign and autonomous thought.

Kenya is the main destination for Tanzania's corn exports. Traders who use the Tanzania-Kenya border crossing of Namanga said business WAS no longer as usual after veteran Kenyan opposition leader, Raila Odinga, called for weekly protests.Odinga accuses President William Ruto's government of failing to tackle the high cost of living.Most Tanzanian traders deal in corn, making Tanzania the largest exporter of corn to .Tanzania sells about 72,460 tons (65.7m kilograms) of corn to Kenya annually. In contrast, the annual demand for corn in Kenya is estimated to be 600,000 tons.The traders who spoke to DW at the Namanga border crossing said that Kenyan politicians should deal with the current situation so that they can resume doing business inside Kenya. , who often take advantage of the demonstrations and steal their merchandise.""Demonstrations in Kenya are affecting our businesses because Kenyans are big trade partners, especially buying our corn,"" one Tanzanian trader, who chose to remain anonymous, told DW. ""As a result, we are currently incurring losses, and goods volumes have decreased tremendously since the protests began."" Likewise, the trader said that Kenyans could not cross into Tanzania to do business like before.""We Tanzanians are peace-loving people. However, when we hear of demonstrations in Kenya, we are afraid and have to stay here in our country where we feel safe. Many traders now fear crossing into Kenya to do business,"" the trader said.Another trader explained they were now waiting for Kenyans to sort out their issues before doing business with them again. ""If they continue their weekly demonstrations, we shall conduct business internally,"" he added.The protests declared illegal by the government have increasingly turned more violent, with , water cannons, and occasionally live bullets.Odinga has called for weekly protests every Monday and Thursday. The former Prime Minister alleges that Ruto stole the election.""Kenyans must get justice. We will not relent,"" Odinga told crowds of cheering supporters, many waving green foliage in a sign of peaceful demonstration.""The cost of living is rising daily, and we will not keep quiet. We are telling Ruto that Kenyans are tired,"" Odinga said.Steve Odhiambo, a 31-year-old unemployed graduate, said he was demonstrating over the vote, joblessness, and high food prices. ""We want Raila to tell us [to protest] daily... We won't relent,"" Odhiambo told Reuters.Alice Achieng, another protester, also said many Kenyans can't afford basic commodities to survive.""We are suffering in Kenya, and we are hungry. We are fighting for our rights, and we want a reduction in the price of flour. We are suffering.""The price of a 2 kilogram (4.4 pound) maize flour packet increased to 179.98 shillings ($1.36, €1.25) in February 2023, up from 134.79 shillings in April 2022.In addition, Kenya's inflation rose to 9.2% year-on-year in February from 9.0% a month earlier, primarily driven by food and transport prices, according to statistics from the World Bank. However, Kenya's Central Bank insists that the current inflation stands at 8.75%.During the campaign for the August election, Ruto portrayed himself as a champion of the oppressed and vowed to improve the lives of ordinary Kenyans. But he has since removed subsidies for fuel and maize flour, a dietary staple, and last week Kenya's energy regulatory body announced a hike in electricity prices. voicing fears of a repeat of the 2007/08 post-election ethnic fighting that claimed the lives of more than 1,100 people.In a statement Wednesday, eight foreign embassies, including the US and British missions, called on ""all leaders and all Kenyans to maintain peace, show restraint, and work toward a swift resolution for the common good of Kenya.""The African Union also appealed Tuesday for calm and political dialogue to end the chaos.Ruto, who was back in Kenya after a trip to Germany and Belgium, sought to assure a US-East Africa business forum that the country's business environment was stable, but did not mention the unrest.In all, two civilians have been killed so far, and 51 police officers as well as 85 civilians have been injured, according to government figures.To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that ",Politics,politics news

241,2023-04-02,DW News,Is Kazakhstan misleading world on firms fleeing Russia? – DW – 03/28/2023,"More than 20 foreign firms that fled Russia after its invasion of Ukraine relocated to Kazakhstan, authorities in Astana claim. DW reached out to some of those companies to find out the credibility of these assertions.Right after  in February 2022, Russia faced . Some were leaving in fear of possible reputational loss, others due to sanctions imposed on the Kremlin by the West and some to mark their protest against Moscow's aggression.The exits were viewed as an opportunity by . In March 2022, barely a month after the invasion, Astana started negotiations with 362 foreign multinationals which had publicly announced their plans to cease or suspend work in Russia, said Deputy Foreign Minister Almas Aidarov at the time. In late December, the Foreign Ministry announced that over 20 foreign companies had relocated their regional offices or manufacturing from Russia to Kazakhstan.The list included big names like US software industrial company Honeywell, Australian iron ore miner Fortescue, Japanese trading house Marubeni, Chinese-owned short-video sharing app TikTok and US ride-hailing service inDrive. DW reached out to some of the companies on the Kazakh list to ascertain Astana's claims. As it turns out, some of the firms named on the list have been present in Kazakhstan for years and are now only executing their long-planned expansion strategy, Others refused to confirm Astana's assertions, or declined to comment.The authorities in  didn't respond to several requests from DW for comment.TikTok was among the first foreign firms to react to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In March 2022, TikTok decided to suspend livestreaming and new postings for users in Russia. The reason was a law passed by the Russian parliament just a week after the invasion that  for spreading any information about the Russian military that the authorities deemed ""fake"" on any platform, including social media.""Our highest priority is the safety of our employees and our users,"" a TikTok spokesperson told DW, adding that the company continues to ""evaluate the evolving circumstances in Russia to determine when we might fully resume our services.""As a result, . The remaining staff was offered other options, among them relocation. While TikTok refused to reveal any information on its employees' whereabouts, it said some of them had been relocated in accordance with the company's global and regional business needs.TikTok, owned by China's ByteDance, also decided to focus on the Kazakh market, its spokesperson said. In October, the company and Kazakhstan's IT center, Astana Hub, launched a joint education project for the country's startups. Back then, Theo Bertram, TikTok’s vice president of European public policy, said the company was willing to develop business in Kazakhstan and open a representative office there,  reported.The TikTok spokesperson didn't specify how far the company has advanced with its plan, but stressed that it doesn't intend to relocate its Russian business to Kazakhstan.Another multinational company mentioned by the Kazakh authorities was the German manufacturer of building materials Knauf Group. The firm's name on the list is a little surprising, considering it's among a host of German firms that continue to do business in Russia despite intense public pressure. Russia contributes 10% to Knauf's global turnover.""It's not about money for us, it's about 4,000 employees,"" the company's chairman Alexander Knauf told German publication  in October. ""I know some of them for 30 years. Loyalty to these people means to me that I won't send them off into an uncertain future."" He added, however, that his firm has complied with the sanctions imposed on Russia and that it had wrapped up its investment in the country and suspended trade between Russia and the European Union.In a response to DW, Knauf Group didn't confirm the information on its relocation to Kazakhstan. However, the firm did elaborate on its plans to build a new manufacturing facility in the country — a project that was announced by Astana in late December.""We have long been planning to expand in the south of the country. The reasons are growing demand for environment-friendly gypsum boards in Kazakhstan and the need to supply the neighboring markets like Kyrgyzstan,"" the company said, adding that it has been in dialogue with local authorities for a few years now. Knauf already has three production sites in Kazakhstan.Unlike Knauf Group, which plans to begin construction of its new facility as early as 2024, US industrial giant Honeywell already opened a plant for advanced automation and safety equipment in Kazakhstan in July. Kazakhstan's Foreign Ministry mentioned Honeywell next to Knauf on the list of foreign multinationals allegedly relocating to the country from Russia.However, just as in the case of Knauf, Honeywell's decision to build a manufacturing unit in Kazakhstan had nothing to do with the current geopolitical tensions between Russia and the West. The plant had been planned way before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the company said in an emailed statement. ""We follow a plan of local growth there [in Kazakhstan] that we embarked on more than two decades ago,"" Honeywell said. ""Work on our Almaty assembly facility opening began several years ago.""The plant's opening was followed by  to completely shut down its businesses and operations in Russia. In response to DW's request for comment, the company confirmed it was no longer conducting any business in Russia. According to the Foreign Ministry, Honeywell is opening a regional office for Central Asia in Almaty that is set to replace the one it had closed in Moscow. The company didn't comment on this development.Australian green energy and resources company Fortescue is another big name on the Kazakh list. According to Kazakhstan, Fortescue closed its Moscow office and moved it to Kazakhstan. However, the company never really had an actual office in Russia. Its green energy arm, Fortescue Future Industries (FFI), only had a small team of a few people undertaking preliminary work in Russia, the company said.""FFI will not tolerate one country invading another, and a decision was therefore made to withdraw from work in Russia,"" Fortescue told DW. It also pointed out that it never had any assets or investments in Russia.On the other hand, the company has had a presence in Kazakhstan since 2019. In November, FFI and Astana agreed to jointly explore the ""potential delivery of renewable energy projects and green hydrogen production in Kazakhstan.""A similar response came from Japan's biggest trading house Marubeni, which Kazakhstan's Foreign Ministry claimed had partly relocated its representative office from Moscow. Marubeni, which has been working in Kazakhstan since 1993 with investments in some big projects, said it always looks for new projects in the country but that it was not accurate to describe its Kazakh plans as a relocation.""It is true that since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, we have been paying more attention to Kazakhstan and Central Asian markets,"" the company said in an emailed statement. Marubeni also pointed out that it has been strictly complying with sanctions imposed on Russia and that it will not engage in any new Russia-related business and will ""negotiate terminations of existing transactions wherever possible.""For now, Marubeni continues to be a stakeholder in Russia's Sakhalin-1 oil and gas project, by virtue of it being a part of the Tokyo-based consortium SODECO (Sakhalin Oil and Gas Development Co) which owns a 30% stake. In November, the Japanese stakeholders in Sakhalin-1, which also include Japan's government and the trading house Itochu, decided to retain their stake in the project, formerly led by Exxon Mobil. The US energy company exited the Sakhalin-1 venture in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Meanwhile, at least one foreign company on the list published by Astana has indeed relocated from Russia to Kazakhstan.US ride-hailing service inDrive said in spring 2022 that it would move part of its Russian personnel to Kazakhstan. After the war in Ukraine began, Kazakh authorities approached the California-headquartered startup and offered to facilitate relocating its staff, inDrive founder Arsen Tomsky told . The company ultimately moved most of its Russia-based employees to Kazakhstan, which Tomsky described as ""the most suitable and stable place in the region.""The largest of inDrive's 17 offices globally will be located in Almaty, with nearly 1,000 employees working there in 2023, Tomsky told the Russian publication VC.ru.",Business,business news
242,2023-04-02,DW News,"China's surveillance tech: Western bans, global growth – DW – 03/29/2023","As the West cracks down on Chinese tech, video surveillance firms are also facing increased scrutiny. But global demand for Chinese surveillance cameras isn't waning, despite fears they could be used for spying.Do you have a security camera at home? If so, there's a good chance it was made by either Hikvision or Dahua, two  companies that are dominating the business of video surveillance. In 2021, they made up over one third of a global market worth around $35 billion (€32 billion), according to the latest data of market researcher IDC.But while Chinese companies like Huawei are increasingly  in European countries, the two surveillance giants have received relatively little attention – even as their equipment watches over airports, train stations and even government buildings all over the world. Tens of thousands of Hikvision devices are currently in use in Germany, including in police stations and ministries, according to recent media reports.Not everyone is happy about this. The Chinese government owns parts of both companies, and their presence in critical infrastructure has led to worries about potential . Critics warn that their systems may have built-in back doors, through which Beijing could secretly syphon off sensitive data.Such security breaches are difficult to detect. But Beijing does have a more obvious access to data that it is potentially interested in:""If we look at the Chinese laws, it is very clear,"" says Antonia Hmaidi, a researcher at Berlin's Mercator Institute for China Studies. ""Every Chinese company has to cooperate with the government and hand over data, if asked. This includes data stored in the PRC that was gathered abroad.""This is why many countries are banning Chinese firms. Telecommunications providers Huawei and ZTE may be the most prominent cases, but Western governments have increasingly been trying to rein in Hikvision and Dahua as well. Since late 2022, Australia and the UK have decided to  from government sites and other sensitive areas. The United States have , citing an ""unacceptable risk to the national security.""The two surveillance companies are also facing severe allegations of enabling human rights abuses: Several independent reports have found Hikvision to be providing video technology used in China's .Considering such grave concerns, how were the Chinese behemoths able to secure such a dominant position in the first place?The answer can be found on their price tags: Hikvision equipment can be up to ten times cheaper than its competitors, according to a 2021 report from digital rights NGO Access Now. A price gap that's hard to explain within the rules of competition.""The concern is that because they're so tightly coupled with the government, they may not be playing fair in terms of the price of their technology,"" says Mike Jude, a market analyst at IDC specializing in video surveillance. This brings a decisive advantage in poorer countries in the Global South, where Jude sees a large potential for the video surveillance market.Take Latin America, where analysts project an annual market growth rate of over 13% for the next few years. Governments across the region are already expanding their video surveillance capabilities, including tools for biometric recognition. But data protection laws in many countries are insufficient to hold authorities and companies accountable. This poses a threat to people's privacy, Access Now told DW.In their efforts to amp up public surveillance, governments in the region have often turned to Chinese manufacturers. Along with cheap prices, Hikvision has also tried to increase its presence by providing free equipment to some countries to test drive, or to detect infections during the Covid-19 pandemic. The company is also expanding in less subtle ways, opening an assembly site in Brazil and acquiring Mexico's largest security systems company, industry research group IVPM reports.To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that The market for surveillance technology is likely to continue to grow, both within Latin America and globally. While the impact of Western sanctions on the operations of Hikvision and Dahua is hard to assess, overall demand for their products is unlikely to wane anytime soon.To safeguard data gathered by video surveillance systems, bans and sanctions that exclude Chinese companies could provide a remedy. But cyber-security expert Antonia Hmaidi sees the need for improved security in surveillance systems more generally. In Germany, for example, most of these systems are currently not updated regularly, she explains – no matter where they were built. This leaves them vulnerable to . ""And we know that state-sponsored and private actors operating from China are very active in this field,"" Hmaidi adds.Longer-term solutions for improved cyber security, she says, must include transparent rules obliging all video surveillance providers to keep their devices updated and, ideally, to keep their servers outside the reach of authoritarian regimes.Current global trends, however, do not seem to be pointing in that direction yet.",Business,business news

Thirty years ago, on March 29, 1993,  formally amended its constitution and adopted the ""socialist market economy"" as the country's economic system.   The move marked a significant step in the nation's  following years of political, social and economic upheaval caused by the Great Leap Forward and It laid the foundation for the ""development of the socialist rule of law,"" and by incorporating the concept into the constitution, shaped the direction of China's economic development, according to the , the newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party's Central Committee.""China's first real major economic reform began in the rural areas in the 1980s, when state-run factories were converted into private ones and some local officials began their own small factories,"" said Dexter Roberts, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's Indo-Pacific Security Initiative.According to Jane Golley, an economist at the Australian National University (ANU), this first wave of economic opening-up boosted rural incomes and facilitated some migration of China's vast rural population.The agricultural reforms and the establishment of special economic zones also helped, she added. The reform and opening-up process accelerated after Deng Xiaoping, China's paramount leader at the time, embarked on his famous ""southern tour"" in early 1992, when he visited key coastal cities and delivered speeches highlighting the need to remain steadfast on the reform path.To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that Following the tour, the focus of economic reform shifted from rural to urban areas.Roberts from the Atlantic Council told DW that one important feature of China's urban economic reform was that the Communist Party gave entrepreneurs and enterprises more autonomy to make decisions.""Entrepreneurs took things into their own hands and they began to decide what they wanted to produce or what they wanted to sell,"" he said.In the subsequent years, China carried out a series of industrial reforms, including the prominent program of ""Grasp the Large and Let Go of the Small,"" in which the government tried to maintain control over some of the largest state-owned enterprises (SOE) while giving up control over smaller SOEs. oversaw rapid economic growth, and also changed the constitution to let private entrepreneurs and enterprises play a more important role in the , Roberts said.""Jiang allowed private entrepreneurs to become party members, which was a huge deal,"" he noted.In 2001, China joined the World Trade Organization, another pivotal moment that further opened the Asian nation up to the global economy. ""It was a very long process that involved significant commitment [from China] to play the game more in line with the global economic order,"" Golley from ANU said.Andrew Collier, managing director at Orient Capital Research, said that joining the WTO accelerated Chinese growth and turned the country into a global industrial powerhouse.During the first decade of this century, China relied on exports, infrastructure investment and the property market to maintain a high-level economic growth.In 2010, China officially overtook Japan to become the world's second-largest economy, based on nominal GDP.However, problems began to surface as external demand dropped, debt started to pile up and corruption became rampant.To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that And  has been reasserting the CCP's control over the economy, weakening the hand of private businesspeople and tech entrepreneurs, whom he views as becoming too powerful and contributing to widening wealth inequality.Roberts said Xi's move risks ""damaging China's growth model for the last few decades.""""His goal is to have an economy that still has a strong private sector but one that's far more controlled,"" he told DW. ""I think that's a bridge too far. He can't have both of those things at the same time.""Collier said Xi appears to have recognized the need for China to transform its investment-driven economic model to a consumer-driven model.But his political decisions, which include doubling down on the state sector, will hurt Beijing's ability to restructure its economy, he underlined.""Xi is not interested in defunding the state sector in order to give consumers a larger share of the economy,"" he pointed out.""The crackdown on the platform economy is an indication of that. It's a very successful sector and there may have been some market-dominance issues.

The global production of animal flesh for  was  in 2020 than in 2000 as the global taste for meat skyrockets. The carnal boom is being fed through increased  intensity, with animals such as chicken and pigs kept in smaller, more restrictive spaces such as cages, pens and stalls.Though in the European Union,  are concerned for the welfare of farmed animals — and near 60% are prepared to pay more animal welfare-friendly meat production — the caging of hens, pigs or rabbits remains widespread. Welfare concerns . For one, animal meat production is bad for the climate, producing 14.5% of all greenhouse gas emissions — roughly equivalent to the entire global transport sector, according to Greenpeace. Nitrogen-rich feed  given to meat-producing animals also produces manure high in toxic ammonia, which in turn produces the potent greenhouse gas, nitrogen oxide.  impacts animal welfare by damaging the eyes and respiratory systems of battery hens, for example.Animal rights activists  that humane  — including free range egg laying hens — can reduce feed, fuel and water needs, cutting costs and pollution by also recycling nutrients and improving soil.But campaigners ultimately agree that reducing meat consumption and production is the ultimate way to minimize the  and environmental impacts of meat.As the opposite happens, how are farmed animals being treated around the world, and how might  their welfare be improved?To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that In 2021, the European Parliament overwhelmingly committed to prohibiting the caging of farmed animals. A subsequent law being drafted by the European Commission will release all hens, mother pigs, calves, rabbits, ducks, geese and other farmed animals from cages across Europe by 2027.  The law was inspired by a  in the EU to ""End the Cage Age"" that garnered 1.4 million signatures and aims to end the pain and trauma for over 300 million animals who spent all or part of their lives in cages, pens or stalls. This goal has almost been reached by several EU countries: Luxembourg, Austria, Sweden, the Netherlands and Germany are between 98% and 87% cage-free. In Spain, by contrast, more than 86 million animals are farmed in cages, with only 13% of livestock unconfined. With most EU countries having a cage-free rate under 40%, including France (34%) and Greece (22%), freeing factory farmed animals across the region in the next few years seems unlikely.Across the bloc, nearly all adult female pigs who experts say are highly intelligent and crave outdoor space, spend around half the year inside ""gestation crates"" in which they can barely move — let alone turn around. According to the US-based animal rights group, The Humane League, these sows are exploited as breeding machines that continually produce piglets in cold, dark, dirty pens where they often succumb to sickness. They ""are among the most abused animals on the planet,""  the group. In China, the construction of a 26-story pig farm skyscraper rearing 1.2 million animals annually in Hubei province is also raising both ethical concerns and fears that it will become a breeding ground for .Meanwhile,  passed in October in Germany will allow consumers to choose products using more humane production methods. All pork products, for example, will be legally required to have a label that differentiates between five different methods of rearing: barn pen; barn pen and extra space; open-air barn pen; run and open land; and organic. Yet animals raised on organic farms are not immune from suffering. One German  shows that more than half of dairy cows in organic farms have mastitis, a painful inflammation of the udder, yet are still milked daily. While mastitis is also common in conventional farms,  standards prohibit antibiotics and hence limit effective treatment in organic cows. A  by German-based consumer watchdog Foodwatch shows that organically farmed pigs — where animals are given straw and more space, for example — suffer from pneumonia, open wounds and abscesses at almost the same rate as in conventional farms due to failure to monitor livestock health.   While the European Union is one region trying to encourage cage-free farming, around 33.1 billion chickens were farmed globally in 2020 — more than five for every human on the planet. This represents a 130% rise in 20 years, illustrating the scale of the quest to feed the growing lust for animal flesh through ethical, low-intensity methods.Back in the US, broiler  that are farmed for their meat constitute 95% percent of the animals slaughtered worldwide each year for food, note the California-based Factory Farming Awareness Coalition. The US is the world's number one chicken meat producer.Broiler chickens are typically raised with 20,000 other birds in a 16,000 square foot (1,486 square meters) shed, which equals around three-quarters of a square-foot for each bird.Amid this overcrowding, chickens are grown to full size and slaughtered within six weeks. Poultry in the 1950s reached the same weight in around triple the time, according to Compassion in World Farming. Due to the rapid growth of birds bred for their oversized appetites, their legs  their body weight, forcing them to lie on the floor while suffering pain and lameness. Organs like the heart and lungs are also put under strain, resulting in early death.While cows bred for beef globally are partly raised on pastures, they increasingly spend their final months in confined ""landless"" feedlots where they are typically fattened on a grain diet dominated by high-energy corn — as opposed to grass, their natural diet — before slaughter.Feedlots have an average capacity of around 1,000 cows in the US, while in South Africa the largest lot holds 130,000 cattle,  to experts.Cattle around the world — including calves who can spend their whole life in these lots — typically have little or no cover and endure cold, muddy conditions in the winter, or suffer heat stress during hot and dry summers in lots with no shade. In Australia, one of the world's biggest beef exporters, there are some 500 of these feedlots that housed a record near 1.3 million cattle in 2022. According to the  animal welfare group in Australia, the lots' abrasive and muddy surfaces cause lameness, pain and lesions in the cattle due to an inflammatory disease affecting the hooves.Nonetheless, the welfare of cattle in Australia confined to feedlots is making some progress, with over 90% of them now accredited under national animal welfare standards including the draining of muddy pens, hospital pens for sick cattle, and giving extra care to pregnant cows and new-born calves.Proponents of the feedlot system argue it's a more sustainable way to produce meat as forests and other ecosystems are not converted to pasture.

One report suggests the churn rate — the number of people deregistering — from Twitter's blue badge scheme reached 26,000 during one week this month.Twitter's projected $27.8 million in revenue this year from verification will be a far cry from the billions needed to keep the deeply indebted platform from going bankrupt. While Facebook made a $23.1 billion profit last year, a severe advertising downturn has hit the social media giant hard and is expected to extend until 2024. The number of users engaging with Facebook and Instagram also appears to have reached saturation point.""This is what I describe as a risky move,"" that ""clearly could backfire,"" Dan Ives, a Wall Street analyst from Wedbush Securities, told DW. ""Many [Facebook users] could already have one foot out of the door, will this push them out?""Ives estimated that only 3% to 7% of Meta's 3 billion fans will take up the subscription offer, having enjoyed free access to their favorite social networks for more than a decade.To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that Meta Verified will offer little added value for users at launch other than verification. Facebook already has stronger controls in place against impersonation than its rival Twitter, which is often criticized for allowing so many anonymous and fake accounts.""A subscription is only attractive for those who are influencers or companies. I don't think many ordinary users will subscribe as there is no major advantage for them,"" said Martin Emmer, a communication studies professor at the Free University of Berlin, told DW.Meta insists subscribers will also benefit from direct access to customer service teams — something nigh on impossible for most users at present. Their accounts will also get greater visibility in search engines and additional protection against data theft.While these are useful add-ons, Meta will need a ""richer feature set"" to make the subscription plan more attractive, according to Drew Benvie, CEO and founder of the London-based social media consultancy Battenhall.""To reach mass adoption, we will need to see greater entertainment options and core functionality, as the blue badge will only go so far,"" he told DW.Benvie thinks charging for verification may also weaken its prestige as anyone can buy a subscription, rather than the blue badge being reserved for accredited and more trustworthy users, like world leaders, scientists, business leaders and journalists.""Until now, the blue badge has been a symbol of celebrity.

""If you look at Snap [the owner of Snapchat] or anyone else, they're all looking for ways around these limitations.""The need for new revenue streams is also driven by Meta's huge investment in the Metaverse, which will ""take many years to come to fruition, let alone think about making a profit,"" said Paolo Pescatore, founder and technology, media and telecommunications analyst at PP Foresight.While Meta may have been buoyed by similar subscription offers made by Snapchat and Telegram, its biggest adversary TikTok remains free.With more than a billion users in over 150 countries, TikTok is also winning advertising market share from Meta's platforms. A recent survey of 50 top US advertisers by research house Cowen found they intend to do more business with TikTok and Instagram but less with Facebook.""There's a strong appetite for short-form video content as underlined by the success of TikTok. Engagement is key for brands and advertisers. Hence why they are turning their attention to other players who have a more engaged base of users,"" said Pescatore.Social media networks are also perhaps too late to the subscription party.Video, gaming and music streaming services and news sites have long charged for access, leaving little room in consumers' budgets to pay for social media access.

Welcome to the world of Cannabis Cowboys.On January 19, 2023, DW launches , its first investigative podcast.The eight-part true crime series is about a cannabis investment platform called JuicyFields that has affected thousands worldwide. For more than two years, the Berlin-based start-up collected huge amounts of money from from internet users, promising huge returns through investments in medicinal cannabis.DW business reporters Andreas Becker and Nicolas Martin had an early hunch that something was wrong. Becker and Martin thought the promised rates of return were good to be true.So, they decided to investigate. At the time, JuicyFields was paying its investors on time and company managers were free to meet the press. Investors were euphoric and the power of social media helped JuicyFields grow fast.Then, in the summer of 2022, the house of cards before Becker and Martin's eyes. The platform went dead, and content on the company's social media channels was deleted. Thousands of investors in dozens of countries were blocked from their accounts — and still can't access their money today.One investor in Germany, we call him Eddie, invested 80,000 euros. Daniel Johansson from Sweden deposited 350,000 euros with JuicyFields.

The company's website (juicyfields.io) was still online, more than six months after investors had been left stranded.And from time to time the site is updated. Sometimes, the operators seem to be offering investors a refund if they send in copies of their passports and financial details. And most recently, masked men announced in a video that the investment platform would soon be up and running again. Masked men?Police investigations are ongoing. The perpetrators remain at large. Many of JuicyFields' former managers have distanced themselves from the company. Speculations on who is behind it all run wild among aggrieved investors on social media. Some think it was as Russian mafia operation, others point to German aristocrats.In Cannabis Cowboys, DW reporters Nicholas Martin and Andreas Becker work their way down the many rabbit holes and surface to tell an intriguing, criminal tale. They look for the weed that JuicyFields claimed to sell, they follow the money, and they speak with JuicyFields' former staff and partners. And they discover that JuicyFields is no ordinary ponzi scheme — if, indeed, that is what it is. They find smoke, mirrors, and indications of an even bigger secret hidden beneath it all. is about greed, money laundering, and the eternal appeal of getting rich quick. It's about cannabis and a truly unique cast of characters.The search takes Becker and Martin from parties in luxury hotels and the back streets of Berlin to a castle in Switzerland and secret meetings on Europe's borders to the East.The first two episodes of Cannabis Cowboys are  from January 19, with new episodes released each week after that.

That includes the US, where maternal death rates are up. But India's MMR is down.  means new life to most of us — and a unique experience every time, bringing your baby into this world. But in all too many cases, pregnancy also means the end of a life.In late February 2023, the United Nations released a new report on maternal mortality around the world. The report described how or complications experienced in pregnancy.""Pregnancy is tragically still a shockingly dangerous experience for millions around the world,"" said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the  (WHO).In the year 2000, the global maternal mortality rate (MMR) stood at 339. That means that 339 pregnant people of child-bearing age died per 100,000 live births.In 2020, the global MMR was 223.But according to the UN report, most countries around the globe  significantly in that 20-year period.The UN report says there had been a small decrease between the years 2000 and 2015, but that since 2016 the global maternal mortality rate has stagnated. And that is unacceptable, said Jenny Cresswell, a scientist at the WHO and co-author of the report.""Stagnation is absolutely not good enough,"" Cresswell told DW. ""The Sustainable Development Goal [SDG] target is to reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births by 2030. We are currently far off-track to meet this target.""To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that In some countries, including developed ones like the US, the maternal mortality rate has been rising for years.At more than 23, the US has by far the highest MMR of all industrialized countries. The rate increased by roughly 78% between 2000 and 2020.With low total numbers, even minor changes make for a high increase in the percentage of a number. But that doesn't change the fact that the number of pregnant people who die during pregnancy, childbirth or shortly thereafter, has been rising for decades in one of the richest countries in the world.It is not easy to explain why the MMR is going up in the US said Munira Gunja, a senior researcher with the Commonwealth Fund, a foundation that supports independent research on health care issues in the US.Gunja said that a number of factors may be contributing to the situation, including ""a lot of underlying health conditions [that] have been on the rise for years now.""Then there is the fact that many Americans do not have  and can not afford to visit their doctor. The cost of health services has gone up as well. And there is a shortage of midwives who can help people through their pregnancies. ""The rate at which people in the US skip [medical] care is dramatically higher compared to other developed countries,"" Gunja said. It all comes together to contribute to ""this unacceptable maternal mortality rate,"" Gunja said.But that is not all. The  is about three times higher than among white Americans.That stark difference is due to ""structural ,"" Gunja said. ""[Black Americans] are at a disadvantage from the start: Where they live, their education level, their jobs and salary. And when they see a doctor, they are often faced with direct racism.""Gunja said it would make a big difference already if there were more active midwives in the US. Midwives can build a close relationship with the pregnant person, take care of them at home and check in during the post-partum period, too ― which is when half of all maternal deaths in the US occur.But things may also need to change on clinical and on policy levels.On the clinical level, healthcare professionals need to spot the warning signs right before, during and after a baby is delivered, said Usha Ranji, associate director for women's health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit organization focusing on health issues in the US.""Some of the factors contributing to maternal deaths were hemorrhaging during and after delivery as well as  [blood poisoning], eclampsia and pre-eclampsia [seizures during childbirth],"" said Ranji.When these things go unnoticed, they can be deadly.Ranji said training among doctors and nurses was improving, those who worked in labor and delivery, and that there was ""a lot more emphasis on listening and better communication with the patients.""On the policy level, Ranji said it is crucial to get everyone on health insurance because 10% of women of childbearing age are still uninsured in the US and, as a result, less likely to seek and receive the medical care they need.""It's important to get people into care well before they're pregnant,"" to make sure they're in overall good health, Ranji said. ""But it's hard to get into care when you don't have health insurance.""The UN report says South Asia is one of the few world regions where the maternal mortality rate is decreasing. And  has seen the biggest improvement in its MMR. between the years 2000 and 2020. In 2020, India's MMR was at 103 nationwide. That is still a lot higher than the MMR in the US. But while maternal mortality in the US increased at an annual rate of 2.88% from 2000 to 2020, it fell at an annual rate of 6.64% in India during the same time period.Rajib Dasgupta, a professor at the Centre of Social Medicine and Community Health at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, said India had started to see the benefits of a more liberalized and growing economy in the past two decades.""There has been an overall decline in absolute poverty, a sustained increase in key determinants such as women's education and income, and a growing infrastructure,"" said Dasgupta.These social factors all contribute significantly to improving  and preventing deaths during and after pregnancy, according to the UN report.Countries in South Asia that have seen their MMR decrease over the past 20 years ""have made good progress in terms of economic development, increasing female education and other important areas that all play a role,"" Cresswell told DW. ""They have demonstrated sustained political commitment to increasing women’s access to quality maternity services.""But the experts say India needs more political commitment to spread these improvements across the country.""To make it to the SDG target [a maternal mortality rate below 70], the inequity between the Indian states should receive more attention,"" Dasgupta said.A number of Indian states have achieved the SDG target.The state of Kerala's MMR is 19. It is not the lowest rate in India, but it is a lower MMR than that in the United States.At the other end of the spectrum is the state of Assam, with a maternal mortality rate of 195, more than 10 times higher than Kerala's MMR.But even in Assam things are moving in the right direction. , an Indian magazine on environmental and development policy, reported at the end of 2022  between 2014 and 2016. That shows a drop of more than 40 deaths in pregnancy per 100,000 live births.India is on the right path, said Dasgupta — it has invested in medical infrastructure and increased the number of medical personnel across the country and now ""it is the time to build upon this strength.""     ",Health,environment news

Much is also ending up in oceans and severly impacting . Promises by major plastics producers like Nestle and Danone to promote  and include more recycled plastic in their containers have been mostly.The plastics lobby, along with supermarkets in countries from Austria to Spain, sometimes avoid this responsibility by deposit return schemes that include plastic bottles.But there is hope. New universal plastic regulations are currently being negotiatiated as part of a aiming to streamline the production, use and  of plastic using a circular economy model.Still, circular product design also relies on the , which in its current guise is doing little to ease a mounting plastics crisis.    
Most plastic packaging is produced from seven grades of plastic that are largely incompatible with each other, and are costly to sort for recycling.Apart from PET, or Polyethylene terephthalate, the world's most common plastic labelled with a #1, and high-density Polyethylene (HDPE), which carries the #2 symbol, five other plastic types might be collected but are rarely recycled, . PET is the  and there is a strong market for its byproduct used to make drink bottles, food containers or fibers for clothes.But the harder plastics numbered 3-7 have a very small market since the value of the raw material is lower than the cost of recycling.""It's difficult to reprocess and sort through all the plastic,"" said Lisa Ramsden, Greenpeace USA Senior Plastics Campaigner. Mixed container recycling bins contain a lot of contaminates that make plastic unrecyclable, she added.""Recycling is not the problem, plastics are,"" Ramsden explained. With new virgin plastic often cheaper than recycled material, plastic recycling is not economical, she said. The post-consumer plastic resin created from recycled material is being undercut by cheaper prime material, limiting the market for recycled plastics. by New York-based market analysts , shows demand for raw recycled plastic slowing due, among other factors, to rising transport costs for recycling businesses in Asia and a slowdown in the construction sector that creates plastic building materials.Ironically, plastic bag bans in Africa and Asia have limited the amount of feed material, which, in addition to low recycling rates globally, is also raising the price of recycled material. While the price of virgin plastic is at the whim of fluctuating oil and gas prices, these fossil fuels are often subsidized. According to Sander Defruyt, who leads the New Plastics Economy initiative at the US-based non-profit, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, recycled plastic would be more competitive if fossil fuel subsidies were phased out.But companies that produce waste could help undercut low virgin plastic costs by subsiziding plastic recycling schemes under the principle of extended producer responsibility (EPR), DeFruyt said. Such corporate subsidies have been key to the success of  in EU countries like Germany and France, he added. 
The lightweight packets that keep food and snacks likes chips or chocolate bars fresh, constitute around 40% of the world's plastic packaging, according to Defruyt.Known as flexible packaging, the lightweight, multi-layered single-use packets are used to wrap around  in the UK alone.Only around five European countries are currently attempting to recycle these packets, noted DeFruyt. In the US, flexible packaging made up  of residential recycling in 2020.When not ending up in landfill or burnt, the packaging is easily lost or .Part of the problem is their multi-layered composition that is sometimes lined with foil, making it very expensive to separate into recyclable parts. Flexible packaging is also often ""super-contaminated"" with food waste, which also makes it impossible to recycle, noted Defruyt.The packaging industry claims that flexible packaging has environmental benefits as it's lighter than more rigid plastics and causes less transport emissions while also keeping food fresher for longer.Efforts by the flexible packaging industry to make the packets  are doing little to raise recycling rates.To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that In a  of over 23,000 people across 34 countries, nearly 80% would support banning types of plastic that cannot be easily recycled.This would include a global ban on products and materials made from hard-to-recycle plastics.

It is the first Yiddish-language album that has topped the European World Music charts.When psychologist Paula David started her new job as a social worker in the Baycrest Centre, a Jewish home for assisted living for seniors in Toronto, Canada in the early 1990s, she had no idea what she was in for.Although she had been trained in group trauma therapy, the field of study was not as developed as it is today.Meanwhile, the 14 elderly women who met her regularly for group therapy were all survivors of the  from Eastern Europe.The women did not initially want to speak about their childhood and youth.""In the beginning, they told me very clearly that they cannot tell these stories, that they had no words for them,"" said David.Instead, the psychologist spoke to the participants about their daily lives, their children and their grandchildren for a year.Over time, some of the women were showing early symptoms of dementia, meaning their earlier, traumatic memories were clearer than more recent experiences.Finally the ""dam broke,"" as David said once in a TV interview. Now that the women trusted her, she heard shocking testimony of human experiments, torture, the loss of children or other close relatives, of sexual abuse, terrible hunger, sickness and forced sterilization.To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that Until then, these women had not even shared their stories with their closest relatives. ""It was the time before  David told DW, referring to the 1993 hit film that shone a light on the horrors of Nazi genocide against European Jews. ""One did not speak so much about the Holocaust. At the time the topic was still loaded with shame.""Every now and then there were breakthroughs with the group — but also setbacks.""Often we were overloaded,"" David said. ""Then we needed lots of cups of tea and spoke about other themes for some time.""David began recording the reports and transcribing them at home. She realized that the participants, whose mother tongue was not English, used a syntax, melody and vocabulary that was completely different from those born in Canada.The language they used was ""infinitely more powerful than I could have expressed it,"" David said. She wrote down the sentences and organized them thematically. And in this manner, poems came into being which she presented to the group.The women could hardly believe they were listening to their own words. One said: ""I can't even write, forget composing poems!"", Paula David remembers. Realizing that these really were their own texts filled them with great pride.The poems gave the Holocaust survivors and David a structure, and they became kind of an emotional outlet for all of them. ""We became poets,"" the psychologist remembers.The group therapy sessions became such an important fixture in the women's lives that they worked family meetings and hairdresser appointments around them in order to be able to attend, David says.Many years later, in 2019, David met journalist and music producer . He was deeply involved with the story of Molly Applebaum at the time. Applebaum had experienced a similar fate as the women in Baycrest.In 1942, Molly began writing her diary as a 12-year-old. In it, she related how she had survived the  in the Polish ghettos because she and her older cousin were hidden by a Polish farmer in a wooden crate that was buried in a stable. The girls could only leave the box at night. Often they were covered with insects, lice and dirt.Molly's mother was shot dead in a ghetto in Tarnow, and Molly never saw her younger brother and stepfather again. Molly's diary, ""Buried Words,"" was published in 2017. Today, she is 92 years old and lives in Toronto.Rosenberg decided to make a music album out of Molly's diary entries and the stories of the women at Baycrest. Not with English lyrics though, but instead in Yiddish and Polish — the languages that the women spoke as children and in their youth.The music would also have to match, so Rosenberg decided to work with Olga Avigail Mieleszczuk, a leading Polish tango expert.Before World War II, tango was one of the most popular music genres in Poland. It was infused with elements from  and Roma music. The era ended after World War II began. Its famous protagonists, lyricist Andrzej Wlast and composer Artur Gold, were both killed in Treblinka.To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that Nine songs fill the album, ""Silent Tears: The Last Yiddish Tango."" Four are originals from the 1930s, composed by Artur Gold. The rest are new compositions by Rebekah Wolkstein and Oscar Strock. The songs are interpreted by the Canadian chamber orchestra , and the accordionist Sergiu Popa.The texts by Applebaum and the Baycrest group are sung by Lenka Lichtenberg, Olga Avigail Mieleszczuk, Aviva Chernick and Marta Kosiorek.The Canadian singer , who is originally from Prague, sings two songs. Lenka's mother and grandmother were prisoners in the Theresienstadt concentration camp, and her grandfather died in Auschwitz. In her 2022 album , she recalls the experiences of her grandmother after discovering her poems in a desk drawer in her former home in Prague. Lichtenberg recently won a Juno, the Canadian grammy, for her album.Lichtenberg is a professional, but ""Silent Tears"" was still a challenge, she told DW, especially the piece ""A Victim of Mengele."" ""I have been singing since I was nine years old, but I had never heard such a horrible subject,"" she said. ""I asked myself: How can I sing something like this?""For days she sat at her piano, ""tearing her hair out"", working her way into the song. Her goal was to find the right balance. As she says, ""To give the song the emotion that it needs without being overwhelmed by it."" In the end she found exactly the right tone.In March 2023, ""Silent Tears"" climbed the charts and reached number 1 in the European World Music charts. International media outlets including Canada's CBC, Germany's Deutschlandfunk Kultur and Austria's ORF reported on the album.Music producer Rosenberg told DW how he and Molly Applebaum's daughter Sharon Wrock were more than astonished by this.""80 years ago, when Molly was buried underground on that farm in Poland, keeping a diary of the horrors she was experiencing,  controlled radio stations across Europe,"" he said.""Now, Molly’s words are being broadcast as music across those same channels in Austria, Germany, Belgium, Italy, Czechia, Croatia, Latvia and more. We both nearly broke into tears trying to wrap our heads around this.""Meanwhile, the women from Paula David's original group at the Baycrest Centre have all passed away. But many other groups have evolved since then. David is happy that the Holocaust survivors have found a new life with ""Silent Tears.""Now, the story of these women is being heard all over the world, in the languages the women spoke as children and in words that were forcibly taken away from them.""Silent Tears"" is an important musical document.

261,2023-04-02,DW News,Israel's military reservists criticize judicial reform  – DW – 03/23/2023,"Military reservists are threatening to stop reporting for duty if Israel goes ahead with its judicial reforms. The unprecedented military protests underscore the growing opposition to the legal overhaul.Former air force pilot Guy Poran gulps down a coffee and quickly eats a homemade sandwich before his next interview. It's a rare break for Poran, who is among the leaders of a group of about 1,300 Israeli ex-pilots, some still active reservists, known as Forum 555. He's been in high demand since several groups of defense force reservists have raised their voices in protest against 's judicial reforms.""It's been busy days,"" he says. Poran has spent the past few weeks giving interviews explaining why the reservists he represents are critical of the legal overhaul proposed by the far-right coalition of .None of the reservists have yet to refuse an order, Poran says. But the air force volunteers have made it clear that if the coalition passes the legislation, the reservists wouldn't be able to continue serving in the defense force.""We're volunteers. If this country isn't democratic anymore ... we're just not going to volunteer anymore,"" he tells DW.The proposed legislation curtails the power of the judiciary and gives parliament the power to appoint judges. In the past, the Supreme Court has on rare occasions canceled laws enacted by parliament. Controversially, a clause in the new law would enable the Knesset to override such a decision by the Supreme Court with a simple majority. Critics are concerned that this will erode  and concentrate power in the government. have been ongoing for almost three months. But it's only recently that opposition to the bill has spread within military ranks.Two weeks ago, reserve pilots from the country's elite Squadron 69 threatened to stop taking part in training in protest of the controversial overhaul. In a letter circulated in the media on Sunday, at least 450 reservists from military special forces, as well as from cyber units including the Mossad and the Shin Bet intelligence agencies, said they would refuse call-ups if the legislation is voted in.Israeli media reported on Tuesday that another reservist group calling itself Brothers in Arms said it would begin to ask its members to sign a 'refusal to serve' declaration should the government go ahead with the reforms.If the overhaul bills are passed, ""we and tens of thousands more with us will stop volunteering for reserve duty,"" Ron Scherf, one of the founders of Brothers in Arms, was  as saying in the .Israeli men and women are usually conscripted into the military for two to three years. Afterward, some continue to enlist for reserve duties well into their forties and later become volunteers. In some units, reservists take on essential roles because of their experience and skills. All the air force squadrons are dependent on reserve pilots, says Guy Poran, and if a large number of those reserve pilots fall away after this legislation passes, ""there is simply no air force.""That's because the air force only has a small group of permanent pilots, made up of the ""young guys"" who come out of flight school, he explains.""All the pilots with a lot of experience of years are on reserve. They come every week for one day of training for years ... and the small amount of pilots that are permanently serving can't do the missions the air force is required to do.""Refusal to serve in the military is typically a taboo topic and further underlines how the government's judicial reforms have .Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has dismissed criticism of his government's plans, describing the judicial reform as a restoration of ""balance between the branches of government.""He has also sharply criticized the reservists and urged the military chief of staff and other heads of security services to ""vigorously fight against refusal to serve.""""There is no place for refusal to serve in the public discourse,"" said Netanyahu at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting on Sunday.This was echoed by Defense Minister Yoav Gallant who warned that the refusal is ""dangerous"" and could ""harm the ability"" of Israel's Defense Force to carry out its tasks.Israel's military is currently engaged in almost daily raids in Palestinian towns and villages in the .Netanyahu's government has made a slight concession, in that it has announced a softened timeline for the legislation. Under the new proposal, voting on most of the proposed changes would be postponed until the parliament's summer session, which begins on April 30.However, it would still seek to pass legislation shaking up how judges are appointed during the current Knesset session, which ends on April 2.Opponents rejected this new proposal dubbing it as the ""salami method"" as only parts of the legislation would be put on hold.In practice, if passed, the legislation would still give the ruling coalition control over the appointment of two Supreme Court justices and possibly the Supreme Court president, as well.It's not the first time that reservists have penned letters or staged protests in times of government crisis. This also happened, for example, during the Lebanon War in 1982, explains Danny Orbach, a military historian at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.""In most cases, it came from the left. It came from reservists who were specifically left-wing, pro-peace, who believed that Israel's policies were immoral or illegal,"" says Orbach.This time is different, though. Now it's also the political center who are demonstrating.""The people who belong to the center have an increasing feeling that they carry the entire state on their shoulders. They pay more taxes, they support the economy, and they support entire groups of the population, especially the ultra-Orthodox,"" says Orbach.""They serve in the army more than others,"" he says, referring to the fact that in general, ultra-Orthodox, or Haredi, men don't have to serve the defense forces. ""They staff the elite units, they volunteer for reserve duty.""With opposition to the judicial reforms also now emerging from within the security establishment, the real test will be once the legislation is eventually passed, he says. ""If the Supreme Court will overrule some of the legislation, and the government will refuse to obey the Supreme Court, then the chiefs of the security services, army, police, Shin Bet, Mossad and others will be in very unenviable dilemma, whether they obey the Supreme Court or the government.""To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that ",Politics,politics news
262,2023-04-02,DW News,Syria: Will the UN investigate its earthquake aid delays? – DW – 03/24/2023,"Locals in northwest Syria say aid delays after February's earthquakes led to unnecessary deaths. They blame the UN in particular. Now a UN commission has called for further investigation. But will it happen? After the February 6 , Muhannad Aswad and surviving friends and neighbors spent the first four hours   to dig desperately through the rubble of their former homes. They heard voices under the debris, including those of children. Aswad heard his own brother.""[My brother] Ammar was a journalist and a relief worker. He was asking for help from under the rubble,"" he recalled. ""We waited for help,"" said Aswad, who lives in Salqin, northwest Syria, in an area controlled by forces that oppose the government of Syrian dictator Bashar Assad. ""But nobody came.""In the end, Aswad lost 25 members of his family in the earthquake, including Ammar. When outside help finally did arrive, ""it was much, much too late,"" Aswad said.Louay Younis, a media activist from the Syrian town of Jinderis, told a similar story. ""It was like the end of the world,"" he said. Immediately after the earthquake, volunteers wielded axes and picks in their attempts to reach trapped survivors.  ""We saw many cases of people who were alive under the rubble for two or three days,"" he told DW, ""but as a result of the slow arrival of outside help, they died.""The  says over  by the earthquake in northwest Syria. More than 8,700 were injured and over 11,000 are homeless.  have been given for the delay in aid reaching rebel-held, northwest Syria. For example, aid organizations based just over  were also affected by the earthquake — humanitarian workers died and headquarters were wrecked — and some roads into Syria were damaged.But the UN  because, as a coordinating organization, it did not call for international urban search and rescue teams to address the dire situation in this opposition-held part of Syria. The UN waited for permission from the Syrian government, headed by dictator Bashar Assad, to do so. This is despite the fact that, for some time now, legal experts have been saying that the UN doesn't need permission for . It also ignores the reality on the ground: The Syrian government doesn't actually control these borders anyway. Syrian rebel groups and the Turkish government do.Head of the UN's relief efforts, Martin Griffiths, had previously apologized for his organization's failure on social media.After the earthquake, Raed Saleh, the head of Syria's White Helmets civil defense force,  the UN had not helped quickly enough and he asked for an apology and an investigation.""Undoubtedly, the response failures in northwest Syria, including of the UN, have directly caused avoidable deaths, injury and morbidity,"" a group of researchers confirmed in a March issue of British medical journal, The Lancet. They also called for ""an independent UN-mandated commission to investigate.""Earlier this week, a UN body, the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria, joined the growing chorus.The commission, which was set up in 2011 to monitor human rights abuses in Syria, was presenting its 27th report to the UN's Human Rights Council in Geneva. During the meeting,  the body supported ""calls by many Syrians and others for a thorough review of the effectiveness of the UN and the wider international community's humanitarian response to the disaster."" The commission's comment was praised by many Syria observers. But what would such a review look like? And could an investigation like this ever bring justice to the Syrians, like Aswad, who have been so tragically impacted?DW called various agencies and offices of the UN and, despite the Commission on Syria's recent suggestion, it remains unclear exactly how any such investigation might proceed or if it would ever go ahead at all.In a statement, the Commission on Syria told DW that it can't do anything more because any such review falls outside of its mandate, which is to monitor human rights abuses inside the country. It would not be the right body to conduct such an inquiry, a spokesperson for the commission pointed out. Another spokesperson at the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, which works more closely with aid agencies based near the Turkish-Syrian border, explained that there would likely be an internal review.""It's normal practice for OCHA to conduct an internal review of its response for any major emergency,"" Kirsten Mildren, OCHA's head of public advocacy, explained. ""This helps us improve the way we respond to future crises and make changes to the system when needed.""However, she added, that review would not have started yet, as aid efforts were ongoing, nor would the results be made public.A future investigation could be supported by the UN's Human Rights Council, Matthew Brown, the council's public information officer, told DW. The Council, or UNHRC, is led by its 47 member states, not by UN administrators, Brown explained. If any member state wanted to convince other countries to request an independent investigation, then this would be one way of getting an inquiry started, he said.The UNHRC is currently in session until April 4, Brown added, but right now, the idea of an investigation into Syrian aid delays is not on its agenda.Another way of getting such an investigation going would be to make a request at the UN General Assembly. This would be more difficult though, because then a majority of 193 UN member nations would have to agree to a resolution — that an investigation into the UN, by the UN — is necessary.The UN's Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also has the power to order such an inquiry. Putting pressure on UN leadership has helped in similar cases in the past. For example, it is how Haitians eventually gained some recompense after  in their country.The illness started to spread in Haiti after  — most likely from Nepal, where there was a cholera outbreak at the time — disposed of ""contaminated fecal waste"" in a major river. In other words, the UN mission introduced cholera to the country. Over the following decade, around 10,000 locals are thought to have been killed by cholera and over 800,000 contracted the disease. Despite various claims made through the UN's internal disputes system, as well as legal claims in US courts and street protests, it was not until 2016 that the UN and set up a special fund for Haiti. Observers suggest that the UN's secretary-general at the time, Ban Ki-moon, finally responded because of public pressure. However, when it comes to a potential investigation into aid delays immediately after the earthquake in northwest Syria, none of these options are being taken up.""It's easy to say we need an investigation, but it's much harder to do,"" a UN staff member, who requested anonymity because they were not permitted to comment publicly on the situation, told DW. ""It's also hard to know which part of the UN would investigate. I do know for a fact that humanitarian agencies inside the UN are looking hard at what happened there and that it's being discussed at the highest levels. People are very sensitive about it. There's the feeling that it was a really complicated situation, but also that it really needs to be looked into."" As for Syrians like Aswad and Younis, who lost friends and family in the disaster, they have no choice but to bear the consequences of decisions made so far from their homes in early February.Aswad would like to see locals better prepared for natural disasters and improved medical facilities in this neglected part of Syria.""I found out that there are thermal and also audio devices that can help determine where survivors are,"" he told DW. ""Why didn't we have any of these here?""The response from the UN and other international organizations was terrible, and too late,"" Younis argued. ""I would like to see UN officials held accountable for their slow response. People died because of them.""",Politics,politics news

DW spoke to the relatives of civilians who were killed. On March 25, 2022, Russian occupying forces shot dead 69-year-old pensioner Valentyna Zen in the yard of her house in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha. Her dead body lay there until the town was liberated by the Ukrainian army a few days later, on March 31.Zen's daughter Tetyana had stayed with her during the first weeks after  but she was no longer there on March 25. She had been evacuated to Kyiv with her son the day before. Her mother had not wanted to go with them. Some neighbors saw what happened to Valentina Zen and later told her daughter how she had gone to fetch water in Sklozavodska Street, precisely where some Russian soldiers were stationed. These reportedly entered the yard later the same day and simply began shooting.Tetyana told DW that the soldiers had killed at least two people a day in their own yards. ""My mother was on the phone when she saw the Russians and heard shots. She ran off in fear and made it into the house, but a bullet came through the door and hit her, piercing her liver. My mother bled to death.""A year has passed since the murder, but Tetyana has yet to be questioned by investigators. The family doesn't know if there will ever be a court case.Valentina Zen's grandson  He also buried her himself in the town.

He had distributed some food to Bucha residents, not far from the Russian checkpoints. He was shot dead when his house was searched, two weeks after eight of his friends had met the same fate on Yablunska Street.  Serhiy said that the Russian soldiers found a cellphone on his father and after searching him, they led him into the woods and shot him.He said that he had spoken to his father, who used the same cellphone, not long before.An official investigation was opened after the murder but Serhiy said that he had spent a year trying to find out how the prosecution was coming along. He said that first the body had to be exhumed and evidence collected, then the original investigator was replaced and it was only recently that he had finally been interrogated.  ""It is going very slowly, but they are making progress,"" he said. ""They tell me what they have done and what their next moves are. It is a tedious process. I don't think the investigation will be wrapped up before the end of the year.""Ukraine's prosecutor general has tallied nearly 11,000  in the Kyiv region alone. Some 700 were registered in Bucha. More than 7,000 criminal cases have already been opened and 118 suspects and 50 individuals have been brought before judges in absentia. Four have been convicted. According to the prosecutor's office of the Kyiv region, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and local police searched the area last year. They exhumed bodies and  to support ongoing cases. Volunteers also assisted authorities, allowing them to collect huge amounts of war crimes-related evidence.Prosecutors say that the investigations are time-consuming because it is difficult to identify perpetrators and practically impossible to arrest them. ""The main aim of this phase of the investigation is to assemble a complete evidentiary foundation as well as eyewitness accounts,"" said Oleh Tkalenko, the deputy head of the Kyiv prosecutor's office.""Interrogators are often able to ascertain the identity of one or the other war criminal by questioning Russian prisoners of war,"" he added, saying that these often gave the names of comrades who had bragged about how many civilians they had killed, tortured or abused.He said that despite the fragmentary nature of the evidence and the laborious process of collecting it, prosecutors nevertheless hoped to bring many suspects before judges and have verdicts handed down before the end of this year. ""After that, these individuals will be added to international wanted lists,"" Tkalenko explained. ""Ukraine has signed a number of international treaties for the extradition of such criminals. We hope that some of them will be apprehended abroad and returned to Ukraine to pay for the crimes they have committed while the war is still ongoing. We will find the rest after we win.""Beyond investigations taking place in Ukraine, more than 20 countries have now opened investigations into Russian war crimes, as defined by their own national legislation. Recently, the  (ICC) in The Hague, Netherlands, issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian Commissioner for Children's Rights Maria Lvova-Belova on suspicion of kidnapping Ukrainian children.      ",Ukraine,russia news
266,2023-04-02,DW News,Hungary's big bet on batteries — and its costs  – DW – 03/31/2023,"Hungary wants to become a key producer of electric vehicle batteries. Government spending has attracted investments, including a new Chinese gigafactory.The sound of whirring, rattling and bleeping fills the springtime air as excavators and dump trucks prepare a vast stretch of land in eastern Hungary for its new purpose: to host one of Europe's biggest  (EV) battery factories.Here, on the outskirts of the city of Debrecen, the scale of Hungary's ambitions to adapt to the electric transition is visible. Chinese-owned Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL) is building its new gigafactory, which will occupy over 200 hectares — over 280 football fields — once finished.By the end of the decade, the factory will be churning out 100 gigawatt hours (GWh) of battery capacity each year. This would be enough to equip a million cars (based on current ) and make Hungary one of the main manufacturers  — in line with the government's plans to become ""a great power” of battery production.The strategic shift follows the trend in one of Hungary's key industries: the automotive sector, which accounted for around 5% of the country's GDP in 2021. As combustion engines are being phased out, Hungary does not want to be left in the dust.About a kilometer from the industrial zone, a bumpy dirt road leads to a handful of houses and a small farm. Albertne Lovas and her husband have  here for the past 35 years.Now they are worried that the new plant will be a health hazard for their crops, as well as for people in the area, despite promises to monitor the environmental impact. Lovas is particularly concerned about the industrial water consumption in the already arid region: ""We have not been able to irrigate with water from the river for five years now, because it's been so dry,"" she told DW.Many locals share her worries. Making batteries is a water-intensive business, and in recent years droughts have been getting more frequent across Hungary.It's unclear just how much water the plant will eventually need. That's because reliable information on the project is hard to come by and is only released in fragments, Marton Volgyesi complains. A chef by profession, he is one of the organizers behind a local initiative called 'Debreceners against the battery factory.'""When it's about popping champagne, the plant is 220 hectares. When it comes to regulation, it's suddenly 65 hectares,"" Volgyesi claimed, referring to the different construction stages of the project being approved separately. ""We want to see information on the capacity of the whole investment, not just parts.""Intransparent communication is a key point of frustration for locals, who feel the decision for the investment was made without their consent. According to a recent survey, almost two-thirds of residents .Many of them are taking to the streets, demanding the project is halted, or at the very least put to the vote. ""The aim is to get a referendum and to at least stop the further expansion of the plant,” says Volgyesi. His group handed in a petition in February and is still waiting for an answer from the city hall.When contacted by DW, the mayor declined to comment. A CATL spokesperson told DW that they are observing the protests, but do not wish to comment on them, adding that resistance is largely based on misunderstandings and false information.Residents and experts alike are also concerned about the amount of energy a plant of this size will need. While CATL says it is investing in renewables and aiming for carbon neutrality, with Hungary's current energy infrastructure this will not be feasible anytime soon. Three new gas plants have recently been announced to supply the industry, which will continue to  through 2050.Apart from maintaining Hungary's energy dependency on Russia, experts warn that the project in Debrecen will mean increased reliance on China. The plant is set to make China the second biggest foreign investor in the country, sparking fears that it could use its economic clout to exert political pressure.Nonetheless, the government has dug deep into its pockets to attract Chinese companies: CATL alone has been promised €800 million ($870 million) in tax and infrastructural incentives — that's over 10% of the total sum invested.""This money is desperately missing from other areas, especially classic state responsibilities like education, health and social care,” says Dr. Dora Gyorffy, an economist at Budapest’s Corvinus University.Such a ""supportive governance environment"" is one of the biggest advantages Hungary has to offer according to a government paper, and has contributed to a boom. Next door to CATL, Chinese battery component maker SEMCORP is building its new facilities, and BMW’s new all-EV factory is under construction on the other side of the town.To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that But all these companies need workers. The battery plant alone will employ 9,000 of them. “One of the biggest problems is whether you can find enough workers,"" says Dr. Márton Czirfusz, who analyzed the Hungarian battery industry in his recent study. Many jobs in these plants do not require specialized skills, he explains, meaning there is a risk they could siphon off employees from local enterprises.But even that probably won't be enough, as Hungary is struggling with . ""I expect that there will be a high number of foreign workers in these factories,"" Czirfusz said. The company contends that Chinese workers will mostly be needed in the first two years, to get the plant running.The government has recognized this need and has been continuously easing immigration rules for several non-EU countries, particularly in Asia. This is in sharp relief to relentless  in Hungary in recent years. The situation could yet backfire, as many locals are unhappy about the prospect of guest workers in their neighborhood.With such a long list of concerns, a number of opposition parties from Hungary's Green Party to  have come out against the project, too. But activist Marton Volgyesi would prefer to keep party politics in the background. ""I think it's much better if Debrecen's civil society takes this into its own hands. And whoever wants to get behind it, can do so,"" he saidSo far, it seems the project will move forward as planned, despite calls to halt it. Cabbage farmer Lovas says she supports the local protests, but has little hope they will make a difference. To her, it's clear that the government has put profit before people: ""They sold the country to the Chinese,” she says.",Business,business news

268,2023-04-02,DW News,Israel protests: What have football fans got to do with it? – DW – 03/29/2023,"Numerous violent incidents have taken place at demonstrations supporting Israel's controversial judicial reforms. Some of the protagonists can be traced back to the country's football stadiums.'s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may have been forced to  in the face of mass protest, but opponents still believe that Israeli democracy is under threat.A wave of popular protests has swept the country in recent months. , being pushed by 's right-wing Likud Party, along with his justice minister Yariv Levin and far-right national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, of the Jewish Power party. But tens of thousands have also taken part in demonstrations in support of the government.Represented on both sides of the divide are some of Israel's most political and well-organized football supporters, who have taken the debate to the country's sports arenas.Among the fans opposing the government reforms are groups associated with Israeli sports club Hapoel Tel Aviv. Best known for it's Israeli Premier League football team, a few hundred fans recently took their protest to the club's basketball game against Hapoel Jerusalem.""If you don't jump, you're a fascist,"" they chanted, bouncing up and down in unison and adding: ""Yariv Levin, we're not in Poland here,"" referring to By directing their ire at Levin, the Hapoel fans were effectively attacking one of their own: the right-wing justice minister is a well-known Hapoel Tel Aviv fan and attends the club's football matches on a regular basis, despite large elements of the club's hardcore support being affiliated with Israel's center-left.""Ultras Hapoel 99"" (UH99), the club's leading ultra group, take pride in their antifascist, anti-racist stance. UH99 also maintain links to other European ultra groups with similar political views, such as those of Hamburg-based German second division side FC St. Pauli.Recently, the connection between UH99 and their St. Pauli counterparts resulted in tensions with Beitar Jerusalem fan group ""La Familia,"" one of the most well-known far-right organizations in Israel.At the beginning of March, Hapoel's training ground was targeted in what authorities said was a deliberate arson attack. A hooligan section of La Familia, which names itself ""The Tradition Keepers,"" used their Instagram account to seemingly take responsibility, posting a video of the youth team's equipment storage area on fire, along with a photo of a nearby graffiti which read: ""The Holocaust wasn't the only time you were burnt.""During a recent German second division game between St. Pauli and Greuther Fürth, St. Pauli's ultras expressed their support for their Israeli friends with banners on the (south stand) reading: ""Solidarity with Hapoel Tel Aviv FC."" The group also added explicit messages against Beitar Jerusalem and against Nazis, which didn't go unanswered. When Beitar faced Hapoel in the Israeli Premier League, La Familia produced a banner with a combative response: ""Dear St. Pauli, if you think you're so tough, come and stand with UH99 against us — F*** Antifa!""La Familia's position isn't just limited to the terraces; the group has actively taken part in the demonstrations in support of Netanyahu's judicial reforms.Within hours of announcing that they intended to take part in the demonstrations, videos of black-clad groups of teenagers and young men wearing shirts with the initials ""LF"" started doing the rounds on social media.In one case, an Arabic-speaking journalist broadcasting from the protests was interrupted and attacked while a group of young men with La Familia flags stood next to him. According to reports, La Familia members also attacked an Arab taxi driver after the Jerusalem demonstration in support of the reforms.As a result of the violence, some said they will think twice whether they will attend an anti-government demonstration again, especially affecting protesters with families.It's not the first time the group has mobilized for non-football causes.  when the Prime Minister was facing calls to resign . The group chanted a wide range of racist slogans, while also violently attacking journalists, left-wing demonstrators and Palestinians.La Familia are known to have connections with parts of Israel's right-wing political landscape, particularly Itamar Ben-Gvir, the country's far-right national security minister.Ben-Gvir, a lawyer by trade, has represented La Familia members in court on several occasions, prompting chants of support for him during visits to Beitar Jerusalem games — notably against Israel's most prominent Arab club, Bney Sakhnin, a fixture particularly notable for violent incidents and racist chants.The minister is one of the staunchest supporters of the judicial reforms and, as the man responsible for the Israeli police force, he has often demanded tough treatment of protesters., which was banned in Israel in 1994 after Baruch Goldstein, a Kach supporter, murdered 29 Palestinians in Hebron. For years, Ben-Gvir had a photo of Goldstein on his wall, until removing it upon becoming a minister.With the protests in Israel raging on despite Prime Minister Netanyahu's decision to delay the vote on the reforms, and society becoming more divided by the day, the protests are not expected to stop anytime soon, and with them, the clashes between both sides of Israel's political divide.The longer the inner conflict in Israel goes on, the bigger the role organized football supporters are bound to take in the political violence on the streets of the Jewish state.",Sports,science news
269,2023-04-02,DW News,Israel: Judicial reform on hold but country remains on edge – DW – 03/29/2023,"After massive demonstrations and a general strike that halted most public life on Monday, PM Benjamin Netanyahu has called for a temporary halt to a controversial judicial overhaul. Protesters are not convinced.After three months of rapidly growing nationwide protests by opponents of the government's controversial judicial overhaul,  political crisis boiled over on Monday and nearly shut down the country.Emma Tukatly is one of those who has been out in the streets demonstrating for the past three months against the planned legislation. She expressed joy that , had joined a general strike to protest the contested changes to limit the powers of the nation's Supreme Court.""When I saw the Histadrut coming into the strike, besides all the business people of Israel, I get goosebumps even now. I was in front of the TV with my husband and we were crying,"" Tukatly, who runs her own business and is an activist in the anti-government protest group ""Pink Front,"" told DW.At Ben Gurion Airport, Israel's main gateway to the world, most of the flights were cancelled. Local municipalities went on strike, universities closed and civil servants joined the action.""It felt like redemption, really. It felt like everybody is in this and we're going to win and it's going to end in the evening — and that the government might even fall apart,"" says Tukatly.But opponents of the judicial overhaul are certainly not yet satisfied, despite Prime Minister  responding to the protests and strikes with an announcement that the overhaul would be postponed.After much delay, Netanyahu stood in front of the camerasshortly after 8 p.m. local time (1700 UTC) on Monday. He said that  with his political opponents and delay the overhaul to the next parliamentary session, which starts at the end of April.""When there is a chance to prevent civil war through dialogue, I — as prime minister — will take a time-out for dialogue,"" Netanyahu said in the televised address. ""There is an extremist minority that is prepared to tear our country to pieces.""And in a deliberate nod to his supporters, he said that he would pass the reform ""either way."" This was echoed by his far-right coalition partners, who headed a large counterprotest on Monday night in Jerusalem to show support for the legislation.Tukatly was among those rather dismayed than pleased at the announcement.""Now we are looking at a postponement of a month only … it's really hard for me to speak about it. Really. I am like, I am crying,"" she said.The latest unrest was triggered by Netanyahu's decision on Sunday night to . Gallant had suggested pausing the judicial plans 24 hours earlier, citing the deepening divisions in the country and describing the  if the legislation was passed as a ""threat to national security.""A dramatic night of spontaneous protests against Netanyahu's decision to sack Gallant followed across the country. This put the prime minister under growing pressure to address the crisis.But he initially appeared to struggle to get his coalition partners to consider any compromise, especially the far-right minister for national security, Itamar Ben Gvir of the Jewish Power party, who threatened to quit the coalition.Eventually, shortly before Netanyahu's announcement on Monday nighthe struck a deal with Jewish Power in which they agreed to a postponement of the legislation until the next session of parliament. In return, Netanyahu reportedly promised Ben Gvir the establishment of a ""civil national guard.""""It seems that the protests may downshift a little bit, but they won't stop,"" political scientist Dahlia Scheindlin told DW. Protest leaders had announced on Monday night that demonstrations will continue.Many opponents of the legislation simply don't trust Netanyahu, she said: ""They don't believe that he actually plans on ending this attack against the Israeli judiciary. And I think that they will anticipate the need to keep constant pressure to achieve what they really want, which is an end to this legislation altogether.""All the same, the postponement marks an unexpected concession by the embattled prime minister, who just last week vowed to press ahead with a Knesset vote on the legislation's first core element as early as this week, just before the Knesset goes into recess for the Passover holidays.And despite the announcement, on Tuesday the Knesset committee preparing the bills still submitted the draft to the Knesset for a final reading so it could be voted on at any time.Israeli commentators were quick to call Netanyahu's move a tactical pause. ""To Netanyahu's credit, one can say that he knows how to use beautiful words to turn a stinging defeat into a laundered draw. But that won't change the facts. Nor will it change the fact that he lives in an alternative universe: Israeli society is burning, and the most he has to offer is a procedural solution"", wrote Nahum Barnea in the  daily on Tuesday.In the conservative newspaper , a commentator wrote that ""if Likud wants to continue to lead, it must return to the to the pragmatic, moderate approach that has always characterized the party and forget about the 'fully right-wing' dream.""To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that Plans to change the judiciary were introduced almost immediately after the new government, made up of a coalition that includes far-right and ultrareligious parties, was sworn in last December. Supporters of the reforms consider the Supreme Court a far too powerful bastion of the political left. They also argue that there should be more balance between different branches of government.Critics say the overhaul would erase the government's system of checks and balances while affording politicians too much power in a country without a constitution. For example, the so-called override clause could allow lawmakers to potentially override any of the Supreme Court's decisions.As some point out, the potential leverage of lawmakers over the Supreme Court could help Netanyahu evade prosecution as he stands trial for several corruption charges — all of which he continues to deny.On Tuesday night, President Isaac Herzog, whose attempts to find a compromise were rejected by the government earlier in March, held a first round of talks between opposition and government coalition leaders to find a workable framework. ""The meeting was conducted in a positive spirit,"" read a statement by the presidency.But analysts are skeptical as to whether such a compromise is feasible. ""I don't think that they will come to a satisfactory compromise. The government has never wavered from its goal of continuing in this direction of constraining the independence of the judiciary,"" says analyst Dahlia Scheindlin.An opinion poll commissioned by the daily newspaper  on Tuesday and published on Wednesday showed that 52% of respondents said there was nochanceof reaching an agreement, while 41% said that a compromise on the judicial reform could be reached.The overhaul has also put US-Israel relations on shaky ground. On Tuesday, US President Joe Biden issued his sharpest remarks yet as to the prospect of a compromise. He urged Netanyahu, in what was widely seen as a rebuke, to ""walk away"" from the judicial overhaul.""Hopefully the prime minister will act in a way that he can try to work out some genuine compromise, but that remains to be seen,"" Biden said. He also denied that Netanyahu would be invited to the White House ""in the near term.""Netanyahu answered in a late-night statement that ""Israel is a sovereign country that makes its decisions by the will of its people and not based on pressures from abroad, including from the best of friends.""Once the Knesset comes back from its recess, the judicial overhaul will be back on the table.For Emma Tokatly, the most important thing is to keep up the pressure: ""We are not stopping, because Israel's biggest problem is that we don't have a constitution. So, for 75 years, from all parties, they couldn't make this terrible situation right. The only thing we can do to stop this situation is to ask for one thing: A constitution.""",Politics,politics news
270,2023-04-02,DW News,Why do ancient statues have such small penises? – DW – 03/29/2023,"It is considered a symbol of masculinity: the penis. As Michelangelo's David makes headlines as ""pornographic,"" a look at how tiny genitals were once perceived as a sign of merit.In the Vatican Museums in Rome, a group of tourists stands in front of one of the showpieces: The statue of  (also known as the Laocoön Group).The roughly 2,000-year-old sculpture stands at a little over two meters in height, and depicts the Trojan priest Laocoön and his sons. He is said to have advised his compatriots against bringing the Greeks' wooden horse into the city because he suspected it was a trick.And it was. Warriors were hiding in the horse, which sealed the downfall of Troy. That was the plan of , and because Laocoön wanted to interfere with them with his warning, they had him and his children killed by snakes.An exciting story from an ancient period, but one detail in particular catches the eye of the tourists: Laocoön's penis is extremely small — and his is not the only one. Throughout the museum, there are statues of muscular men with tiny genitals.People in the group wonder why the sculptors of antiquity endowed men so modestly. One Dutch tourist, who mentions with a grin that as a retired gynecologist he's not necessarily an expert on ""the bottom part of male anatomy,"" nevertheless offers his theory: ""Statistically speaking, southern European penises are supposed to be smaller than those from the north,"" he says. That was definitely not the reason, clarifies archaeologist and guide Chiara Giatti: ""For , large genitals were considered ugly,"" she explains. ""The stonemasons modeled only small genitals because they wanted to make it clear: This man is a rational intellectual, and as such he has his urges under control.""Thus, the ancient man had a high degree of self-control and knew how to control himself — unlike the barbarians and some gods, including Dionysus, the god of wine, pleasure and ecstasy. He is usually surrounded by satyrs — a short half-man, half-goat (or horse) creature, always naked and depicted as being animalistic and hideous. They celebrated debauched feasts and amused themselves with the nymphs who lived in the forests.""These gods and forest spirits were voluptuous, and their genitals were depicted accordingly,"" Giatti says. Dionysus' son Priapos, whom he fathered with the goddess of love Aphrodite, clearly had the largest. She abandoned the child with the abnormally huge phallus in the mountains. There, shepherds found him, raised him and revered him as a fertility bringer because of his impressive privates.The small penis as an ideal of beauty was initially a Greek affair. Around 2,400 years ago, the comedy poet Aristophanes recorded what the ideal male body should look like: ""A gleaming chest, bright skin, broad shoulders, tiny tongue, strong buttocks and a little prick.""The Romans adopted this idea. And not only them — Renaissance artists such as Michelangelo or Raphael were enthusiastic about the perfectly modeled masterpieces of antiquity and based their work on them.Michelangelo's , for example, created between 1501 and 1504, also has a modest manhood — even though his exposed genitals have been at the center of a recent controversy.The sculpture, which can be admired in the Galleria dell'Accademia in Florence, became even more famous than it already was in the United States after a  decided to force the resignation of its principal over parents' complaints that their children were exposed to the ""pornographic"" Renaissance masterpiece in a lesson.Nowadays, society's perception of the male genitalia has changed. Micro penises are no longer perceived as a sign of intellectual eminence, and for many, large penises are considered masculine and represent success.According to a study published earlier this year by Stanford University in California, they are even getting bigger. The male genitalia has grown by 24% in several regions of the world over the past 30 years, the scientific team reported in .In ancient times, these proportions would probably have caused aesthetic horror. ""The length doesn't matter, women have known that for a long time,"" comments a tourist from Israel, who is standing in front of the Laocoön group and photographing the ancient appropriately sized genitalia.Incidentally, in Italy penises are colloquially called ""piselli"" — which translates as ""peas.""",Europe,france news

277,2023-04-02,DW News,Ukraine counteroffensive: When will the mud season end? – DW – 04/01/2023,"Kyiv plans to launch a counteroffensive against Russia this spring. A former US military meteorologist has taken to Twitter to provide valuable predictions as to when ground conditions will be right.Sitting in his Virginia home, weather expert and US Air Force veteran David Helms has one question on his mind about far away Ukraine lately: ""When does mud season stop?""The  there is just one more thing that troops in the trenches at the front lines have to battle. In an effort to ease the burden, retired meteorologist Helms analyzes weather that might affect the war and publishes his forecasts on social media under the hashtag ""#NAFOWeather,"" a likely reference to the North Atlantic Fellas Organization, an online anti-Russian propaganda movement.For the front in Ukraine, Helms has the following prediction: ""The loss of moisture from the soil really picks up by May 1st and beyond,"" he wrote in his analysis for DW.In southern Ukraine, the soil will be dry from around mid-April, then two weeks later in the Donetsk region, and from mid-May in the Russian-occupied Luhansk region further north, he explained.Should the prediction turn out to be correct, it could have significant strategic meaning. While Russian tanks are still stuck in the mud in Eastern Ukraine, the Ukrainian army could begin a counteroffensive in the south toward the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol.Helms is one of many digital volunteers worldwide who are supporting Ukraine's fight against the Russian invasion.""To me, it's just people interested in and supporting Ukraine, trying to do whatever they can to do exactly that,"" he said.He writes, for example, about when there will be ""optimal optical satellite intelligence opportunities."" When clear skies allow for the best photos from space, other activists then use donations to order satellite imagery from private vendors like Maxar, passing it along to Ukrainian commanders on the front lines.This spring, forecasts from Helms have special significance: Whoever determines the regionally varying end of Ukraine's mud season gets closer to answering the much-discussed question of when the country can launch a counteroffensive to liberate land occupied by Russian forces.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has referred to the  in his daily video messages. As has his defense minister, who also recently expressed his gratitude for tanks sent by the UK and Germany, in addition to German Marder infantry fighting vehicles.In , the mud season, known as ""rasputitsa,"" renders fields and unpaved roads impassable for around a month in the fall and spring, due to rain and melting snow respectively. Tanks, troop carriers and artillery pieces all become mired down in the soggy earth.""Between the amount of moisture and the volume in the top 20 centimeters of the soil, as the moisture increases, the soil strength decreases,"" Helms said, adding that it's a logarithmic relationship. ""It changes very quickly at certain points as moisture accrues. All winter we've been accruing moisture in terms of snow and the surface of the soil has been frozen largely, although, with climate change, at times the surface layer of the soil thawed out this winter.""The phenomenon has to do with the geography in many areas of Eastern Europe: flat land as far as the eye can see, and with a particular quality of soil. Ukraine's black earth is part of what makes the southern part of the country among the most fertile in the world.Former military meteorologist Helms also worked for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the US, where he studied the hydrological consequences of climate change — that is, changes in the composition of soils like what is going on just now in Ukraine.""Mud season in the context of military vehicles depends not only on the strength of the soil, but also the kinds of vehicles that are anticipated for any offensive operation,"" Helms told DW. Put simply, the heft of tanks and armored personnel carriers, including how many people they carry, determines whether or not they are likely to get stuck in the Ukrainian mud.",Politics,politics news

But the future of American football lies beyond even the college game.In 2023, the NFL's Pro Bowl - an event with the league's star players - included a flag football game for the first time. Recognition of the inclusive, accessible version of American football that is played by people of all ages and genders thanks to its non-contact, low-cost, and easy to understand rules is also recognition of how flag football is reinvigorating the sport's participation numbers and development strategies.A new study led by the Boston University CTE Center has found that, for those playing traditional tackle football, "" may also lead to less white matter in the brain, potentially causing impulsive behavior and other thinking-related problems, whether or not someone has CTE.""This is just the latest piece of evidence around the  and the  often associated with playing the game, both of which have led to a decline in those playing tackle football. As Forbes reported in 2020, in the 11 years between 2008 and 2019, ""the total number of youths aged 6 to 18 playing tackle football fell by more than 620,000.""The International Federation of American Football (IFAF) says there are an estimated 20 million flag football players across more than 100 countries.In Japan, half a million elementary school children per grade now have the chance to play flag football every year while in Mexico there were 100,000 new flag football players in 2021 alone.Most intriguingly, across IFAF's 72 national member federations, flag football will this year overtake tackle football in terms of organized participation opportunities.With Mexico's women beating the United States at the World Games in 2022, Papa New Guinea on the verge of entering its first IFAF tournament and US high school participation of women's flag football up 40% since 2018, it's clear the sport is booming across the world.Vietnam, also one of the 72 IFAF members, is also enjoying a boost in participation, albeit not at the same level.The sport has been around in the country for around a decade, but now it has approximately 400 registered players in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, with the majority playing in the latter, where the creation of the Vietnam Flag Football League (VFFL) three years ago changed the game.""We started out struggling to get enough players each week. We used to play in random parks and the street on Saturday,"" Anetnga told DW. ""We have grown to now having real tournaments on real fields with sponsors.""Anetnga plays for The Swarm, one of six teams in a league now in its fourth season. By using Reclub, a digital platform that allows users to manage teams and competitions, review stats and be a part of the flag community, the VFFL's development has been steady.""This year is the first time the league has had more local Vietnamese players than foreigners, which speaks to the stability of the sport,"" Luis Aloma, co-founder of Reclub and fellow player, told DW.Duong Phan has been playing for nearly a year, and is President of the RMIT Wolves.""I think the spirit and energy of flag football connecting everyone is one of the factors that makes this sport is so special in Vietnam,"" he told DW.""A big part of why I like flag football is the people I've met,"" Anetnga said. ""I've made a lot of friends playing it, especially with the other Vietnamese women that play.

286,2023-04-02,DW News,Bundesliga: Cologne to appeal 'absurd' transfer ban – DW – 03/30/2023,"FIFA has handed FC Cologne a potentially damaging transfer ban for allegedly tapping up a Slovenian youth player. The Bundesliga side intends to appeal at CAS, calling the sentence 'completely absurd.' side  have been banned from buying or selling players in the next two transfer windows for allegedly tapping up a Slovenian youth player, but intend to appeal the sentence.The punishment revolves around the January 2022 signing of then 16-year-old Jaka Cuber Potocnik from Slovenian top-flight club Olimpija Ljubljana, who have accused Cologne of inciting the forward to terminate his contract before immediately signing for the German side for free, and thus costing them a transfer fee. have ruled in the Slovenian club's favor, not only hitting ""FC"" with a transfer ban, but also banning Potocnik for four months and ordering him to pay Olimpija €51,750 ($56,462) in compensation, with Cologne liable to assist him.Potocnik, now 17, has this season scored 13 goals in 13 appearances for Cologne's under-19s, who are in the semifinals of both the league championship and the German Youth Cup.While his ban would be damaging for his age group, Cologne's two-period transfer ban could have potentally disastrous consequences for the Billy Goats, who would be forced to extend the contracts of players they had been planning to release or promote youth products from their academy – all from an unfavorable negotiating position.The already agreed transfer of left-back Leart Paqarada from  this summer would fall through, while the club would also be unable to make central defender Jeff Chabot's loan move from Sampdoria permanent.Cologne are currently 13th in the Bundesliga, and a potential relegation, this season or next, could feasibly even pose an existential threat to the club.Consequently, Cologne have said they intend to appeal the FIFA ruling at the , with chief executive Christian Keller calling the sentence ""draconian,"" ""completely absurd"" and describing the whole situation as a ""farce.""""FIFA have delivered, in our opinion, a completely absurd sentence devoid of any justification,"" the 46-year-old told German media on Thursday morning, insisting that Cologne have proof that Olimpija Ljubljana hadn't honored clauses in Potocnik's contract, that the player was therefore justified in terminating it, and that Cologne had not acted illegally.Keller claimed that a meeting had taken place with Olimpija officials in August 2022 at which a settlement in the region of €250,000 had been offered. Despite apparently expressing written thanks for the discussions which they said took place in a ""great atmosphere,"" the Slovenians rejected the offer, which they considered beneath their valuation but which has since proven to be five times higher than what FIFA have now ordered Cologne to pay.""What Olimpija were demanding was completely detached from reality,"" said Keller.Amid strong criticism of both Olimpija and FIFA, Keller said his immediate hope was that the punishment be at the very least suspended until the result of the CAS appeal, allowing Cologne to enter the transfer market this summer.Olimpija vice-president Christian Dollinger claimed to the local  newspaper: ""I presume that FIFA have justified their sentence in such a way that it will retain its validity in the next instance, and that Cologne's CAS appeal will therefore be unsuccessful.""Any transfer ban would not apply to Cologne's women's team.mf/mb (dpa/SID)",Germany,germany news
287,2023-04-02,DW News,Germany's goalkeeper generation after Manuel Neuer and co. – DW – 03/04/2023,"Germany has long been considered a ""nation of goalkeepers,"" but the number of regular German keepers in the Bundesliga has reduced year after year.At the end of the 2012-13 season, 83% of the first-choice goalkeepers in the Bundesliga were German. In other words: 10 years ago, a German keeper stood between the posts of 15 of 18 Bundesliga teams.Things have changed dramatically since then. There are only seven Bundesliga clubs with a German keeper at the moment. The youngest is Cologne's Marvin Schwäbe, and even he is 27 years old. Young German keepers who get regular Bundesliga minutes are a rarity.""If you look at the top talents of the last decade, players like Manuel Neuer, Marc-Andre ter Stegen, Thibaut Courtois and Jan Oblak, and looking a bit further back, also Gianluigi Buffon and Iker Casillas, these keepers had already played an average of over 200 first-team games by the age of 23,"" Marc Ziegler, a former Bundesliga keeper at Stuttgart and Borussia Dortmund, told DW. ""Our young keepers are nowhere near that.""Since 2015, Ziegler has been head of goalkeeping at the German football association (DFB), and his work involves developing young male and female keepers from U15s up.""Pressure in competition has increased, as has the value of the league,"" Ziegler said about why fewer German and hardly any young goalkeepers regardless of country play in the Bundesliga.""The Bundesliga is one of the top three leagues in the world, so teams are looking for competitive goalkeepers. Keepers who come from abroad bring a certain amount of experience. Most of them have already played internationally, both for their countries and in European competitions.""Observers say this development could leave the men's national team short of quality in between the posts in the years ahead.""I'm deeply concerned,"" former Germany goalkeeping coach Andreas Köpke recently told Sport1 when asked about the generation after Manuel Neuer, Marc-Andre ter Stegen and Kevin Trapp. The DFB is aware of this and has improved the coaching of goalkeepers in recent years.In cooperation with the goalkeeping coaches at the Bundesliga clubs, Ziegler and his team have developed a ""goalkeeper DNA"" that outlines 10 traits that modern keepers have to have in order to be able to compete at the top level.This is about much more than stopping shots. Being able to play in space so as to catch crosses and chase down balls is key, as is constantly adapting positional play, organize the team from goal and starting attacks themselves. Alongside the football requirements are also some mental traits.The profile of a modern exceptional goalkeeper is complex, largely because the current crop of Germany keepers have raised the bar.""The goalkeeping generation around Manuel Neuer, Marc-Andre ter Stegen and Bernd Leno generated added value for the coaches because they can play football,"" Ziegler said.These abilities have now become standard.""The current generation has it tough because they don't bring a similar added value,"" Ziegler said. On the contrary, the older keepers know this routine already. ""That's why a head coach will likely start a more experienced keeper, so long as he's not out of form. The young generation has to be patient, until age forces change,"" said Ziegler.Given that regular playing time at the top level in full stadiums is absolutely required in order to become an exceptional goalkeeper, career planning is particularly important for goalkeepers.""There are two choices: the approach of getting minutes is for keepers who are already talented and confident enough that they believe they can do anything. These are the ones who need playing time,"" football agent Stefan Backs told DW.Backs' current clients include Alexander Nübel, the Bayern keeper currently on loan at Monaco, and Schalke's long-standing keeper, Ralf Fährmann. The other choice, according to Backs, is for keepers who need time to grow accustomed to a certain level.""For those keepers it often makes sense for them to move to a bigger club and be second choice in order to learn skills and traits that might be missing,"" Backs said.""Of course I'm happy to see young German keepers get a chance. We try to make clubs aware that we have talented keepers who can perform at this level,"" said Ziegler, who knows from personal experience what it is to be thrown in at the deep end as a young keeper.In 1995, head coach Rolf Fringer made the 19-year-old the No. 1 at Stuttgart, even though the experienced and former Germany keeper Eike Immel was on the squad.""When you put a young goalkeeper in goal, you have to allow for a certain dip in his performances, offer him support and accept his mistakes,"" Ziegler said.The keepers that have currently caught Ziegler and his team's attention are Noah Atubolu and Jonas Urbig.Atubolu is currently No. 1 for Germany's U21s, regularly trains with Freiburg's first team and plays for the second team in the third division. He has even already played in the German Cup and the Europa League. The 19-year-old Ubrig left Cologne for second-division Regensburg on a loan move in order to play more games.Ziegler said dropping down a division was not a bad idea, although the next step then must follow.""If playing for Germany is the end goal, then international playing time is of course a requirement,"" Ziegler said. ""That is something we still have to work on.""",Germany,germany news

Georgia Stanway got the winner to cap a display that said much of the England star's status.""If there's one player in the world I would want to take a penalty in the 83rd minute of the most important match of the season, it's Georgia, because she is so calm.""That glowing endorsement from Bayern Munich head coach Alexander Straus followed a masterful midfield display from  that led the team to the top of the  after a well-deserved 1-0 victory over title-rivals, and holders, VfL Wolfsburg.Stanway proved the maestro of Bayern's perfectly-orchestrated win; driving forward from deep into gaps left by the Shewolves' backpedaling defenders, forcing goalkeeper Merle Frohms into multiple full-length saves and rattling the crossbar with a stinging shot from just outside the box.Such was the diminutive 24-year-old's dominance throughout the game, that Straus had no doubts his team would have the lead as soon as they were awarded the spot-kick seven minutes from the end of time.""I knew she was going to score,"" he said to DW, with a wry smile on his face. ""Stanway's fantastic and she has been .""""She's grown a lot since she's been here, I'm so impressed by her resilience and robustness, to play so well week after week. """"She covers so much space and even though she’s not that big she wins a lot of one-on-one situations defensively. She hasn't been here that long, but she is a really important player in our team.""When Stanway moved to Munich in July, a week after , the former Manchester City player was seeking stability on the pitch.Her time towards the end with City came with challenges and unhappiness, being played in a variety of positions that rarely allowed her to settle or showcase her full range of talents.With Bayern though, Stanway's doggedness in the middle of the park has earned the trust and respect of Straus, who also joined Bayern at the start of the season, and her teammates.Stanway took over penalty responsibilities from German international Lina Magull after the England player netted from the spot against Duisburg earlier this month and echoed the conviction of her coach in her abilites.""I've built good relationships and good connections with the players that are around me,"" she explained. ""Sarah Zadrazil and I have got a good balance at the moment, one of us is winning the ball back and one is being able to play it forward.""""It was a good feeling to be the one chosen to take the penalty. I’ve got the trust of the girls and of the coach which gave me the confidence. I’m enjoying my football, I’m playing well and I've got nothing to complain about.""When Bayern slipped five points behind title holders Wolfsburg in October, after a 2-1 loss at the Volkswagen Arena in front of an impressive 21,287 fans, the side looked a step behind their opponents despite putting up a valiant effort.In the months since though, Stanway's impact on the team has become evident, with Bavarian side having won their last 14 matches on the trot.Despite still not being able to communicate in German, a learning process that is ongoing, she has found a way to make sure her teammates understand her.""I’m leading in the way that I’m shouting,"" she said. ""In the way that I’m telling people to go left and right, to press and hopefully the girls in front can hear and understand that leadership.""""I’m just very confident in our tactics. It’s sometimes a little bit difficult to make sure everyone understands but the manager has got the trust in me, and I’ve got the players full support behind me.Though it took until the dying moments of the game for Bayern to earn a vital victory, there was only one player who looked likely to make that intervention.And, having moved top of the table with just six matches remaining in the league, while also , confidence is high for Stanway and the team.""This season has been full of pressure and high intensity,"" Stanway added. ""I think today speaks for itself; we got the result that we deserved.

The sport's global goverining body, FIFA, has so far denied them recognition as the Afghan national team.The team is ""like a second family in a strange country,"" defender Fatima Mursal Sadat tells DW. Until a year and a half ago, when the extremist Islamic Taliban took power in Kabul again, Mursal Sadat was a . And in a way, she still is. After all, the 20-year-old wears the Melbourne Victory FC AWT shirt — the last three letters standing for ""Afghan Women's Team.""A year ago, the Australian club gave Mursal Sadat and her compatriots a new sporting home to ""support the Afghan women's national team in their return to football."" Since then, the Afghan women have played in the seventh Australian league.""With all the help we've received, we've settled in well in Australia,"" says Mursal Sadat. ""Life is not too good or too bad because we all are struggling with our family cases and supporting them emotionally and financially."", the Australian government evacuated the Afghan national players. They were in acute danger, because self-confident, educated and football-playing women like Mursal Sadat do not fit into the Taliban's world view.With their flight from Kabul, the Afghanistan women's national team ceased to exist, according to football's governing body FIFA and to the Asian Football Confederation (AFC). Afghanistan have not featured in the FIFA women's team rankings since early 2022. The AFC also recently withdrew the country from the women's Olympic qualifiers for Paris 2024, which begin next April.At the end of February, a statement by the Afghanistan Football Federation (AFF) caused a stir when it announced the formation of a new women's national team and inviting Afghan women living abroad to apply. Apparently, the person still officially listed as the AFF media director, now living in Albania, was responsible for the statement and had the support of FIFA.""The announcement was taken down by the federation,"" Khalida Popal, a former team captain, tells DW. ""And the federation made announcements on local media that nobody outside Afghanistan can represent them, and they have no plan to re-create the Afghan women's national team.""Popal became the first captain of an Afghan national women's football team in 2007. In 2018, she and at least four other female players accused then-AFF President Keramuddin Keram of repeated sexual assaults. FIFA banned later Keram for life after investigating the accusations.Meanwhile, Popal has lived in Denmark for years and has used her organization ""Girl Power,"" to help refugee women gain more self-confidence and independence through sports.In 2021, it was Popal and her organization who orchestrated . In early January, Popal and Afghan Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai co-authored an article in the British newspaper  calling on FIFA to officially recognize the Afghan team in exile in Melbourne as the national team of Afghanistan.""It would mean the world to me and my team here if we could get clearance from FIFA to represent our country and see the Afghanistan flag fly among other countries,"" says Mursal Sadat.""We and the women who played soccer before us made lots of sacrifices on this path and we did not play with our lives to quit soccer after a while. We did it to play soccer again and show the world that an Afghan girl can fight for her dreams and goals.""Khalida Popal, on the other hand, sounds disillusioned. ""As one of the players who played in the very first national team of Afghanistan and fought hard with my teammates to make history and make women's football part of the culture in Afghan society, it's sad to see now it's fading away and it was all for nothing,"" she says.""I was expecting more from FIFA and sports governing bodies, but once again they've shown women's football is always the second and not the priority.""Popal is particularly angry that FIFA did not even consider it necessary to respond to repeated requests from the team in Australia, and to Popal's and Yousafzai's initiative.""It's a shame that the organization that has been calling itself the governing body of football has not yet come up with a single statement to at least stand in solidarity with the players. By staying silent FIFA is indirectly supporting the decision of the Taliban, telling women that they belong in the kitchen.""A DW request to FIFA for comment has also gone unanswered. DW asked FIFA why it is not taking any action against the Afghanistan Football Federation.

They will meet Arsenal, who beat Bayern Munich on Wednesday. reached the Champions League semifinals after playing out an entertaining 1-1 draw against Paris Saint-Germain at a bouncing Volkswagen Arena. A 1-0 win in Paris last week saw them through.Alexandra Popp put the German champions in front, against the run of play, on 20 minutes. After winning the ball back in midfield, she finished off a sweeping move by curling the ball into the top-left corner on the half-slide.The visitors struck back 10 minutes later, when Kadidiatou Diani beat Dominique Janssen to the ball to head her side level.Wolfsburg were guilty of missing a series of second-half chances but held on to set up a final-four clash .""We are mega happy and proud,"" said Popp after the final whistle in an interview with broadcaster DAZN. ""It was a tough fight, also because we missed some huge chances, including me when I hit the ball against the post.""The Shewolves came into their crucial quarterfinal second-leg clash on the back of a last-gasp loss to title-rivals Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga, which saw the Bavarian side leapfrog their opponents at the top of the league table. Prior to the match against PSG, head coach Tommy Stroot said the defeat had made the team hungrier for success. ""The defeat against Bayern has sharpened our senses,"" he explained. ""We want to regain the feeling of winning games.""Speaking about the 14,367 spectators in the ground, Stroot was equally buoyed by playing in front of a larger crowd, saying: ""Being able to play in the big arena makes it [the Champions League game against PSG] more special than it already is.""But, despite the homefield advantage, Wolfsburg began the match against PSG much like they had the first leg, second to every ball across the entire pitch.PSG's biggest threat came through Diani, who thought she had sprung the offside trap and given the visitors the lead after 11 minutes only for VAR to intervene. Though the French striker eventually chalked up a valid goal, the 27-year-old was forced off at the break in tears with a shoulder injury which changed the complexion of the match.Wolfsburg dominated much of the second 45, as Popp, Lena Lattwein and Sveindis Jonsdottir were all denied by the post while Sarah Bouhaddi pulled off a number important saves too.Germany's no.1 Merle Frohms was relatively untroubled but did pull off an impressive full-length diving stop from midfielder Kheira Hamraoui late on.After the much-needed confidence boost, Popp was keen to focus on Wolfsburg's next Champions League opponents, saying: ""We know how Arsenal play and will be well prepared to then hopefully take the last step to the final."" ",Sports,science news
292,2023-04-02,DW News,Bundesliga: Schalke leading way in sustainability – DW – 03/28/2023,"Sustainability is an ongoing topic for Bundesliga clubs. Schalke are looking to forge their own path on the matter and are pooling the knowledge of various participants in a new scheme.Plans for the new wells are already in place and soon the offices, football teams and spectators will all be supplied with water from the club grounds. This is just one of several ecological measures the club has earmarked for the future in its "" Strategy for a Climate Neutral Schalke"" plan.""Above all, we want to assume social responsibility in our region. We see that as our duty,"" Schalke's CEO Bernd Schröder told DW during the presentation of the strategy.To this end, Schalke have launched their own initiative, which is primarily regionally based and has the purpose of pooling knowledge on the subject of sustainability. The ""Zukunftsschmiede 04"" is a network that currently consists of eleven participating parties, from medium-sized companies to those listed on the German Stock Exchange. They also include the RAG Foundation, a group of digital experts and municipal businesses from the region, who benefit from each other's knowhow and ideas when it comes to making the club more sustainable.The issue of sustainability and the various questions associated with it will remain of the utmost importance: Can spectator matchday travel be made as efficient and climate-neutral as possible? How can charging stations for e-bikes be installed? Where can solar panels be installed on the club grounds? How can the amount of waste generated on match days be reduced? are social issues that have long since occupied Bundesliga clubs. In 2022, the German Football League Association (DFL) committed itself to gradually incorporating a sustainability guideline into the licensing regulations for the 36 clubs from Germany's top two divisions that would take ecological, economic and social aspects into account. Starting in the 2023/24 season, clubs that do not comply with the sustainability concept will no longer be able to obtain an operating license.In the future, clubs will be required to provide evidence of an environmental and sustainability strategy. Recently, all clubs have had to submit information on their current status when it comes to water consumption, wastewater production and energy consumption, as well as an analysis of mobility and traffic. The catalogue drawn up by the DFL for this purpose comprises of around 300 different criteria.""The clubs have long been interested in the topic of sustainability. Sometimes regulatory pressure is needed to implement something,"" Stefan Ludwig, head of the ""Sports Business Group"" at auditing and consulting firm Deloitte, told DW. He added that the league's requirements offer clubs new opportunities to make further positive changes.""It's clear to many clubs that it's not just an obligation, but also an opportunity to cut costs. Or to make themselves attractive to sponsors who have previously stayed away from professional sports."" This is also an advantage in terms of existing partnerships, for example with companies on the stock market, who have been obliged for some time to meet sustainability criteria and pass these on to their partners and service providers, says Ludwig.At Schalke, the club wants to take action beyond the adopted measures with a specially launched initiative. The main considerations, according to the club, are ""ecological transformation and the club's corporate responsibility."" In addition to its own efforts, Schalke also wants to act as a ""platform for networks and companies"" for this in the future.""We are not promising heaven and earth, but want to make sustainability more understandable for all members and fans,"" Sebastian Buntkirchen, director of fan affairs and sustainability at the Bundesliga club, told DW. For example, the Royal Blues have maintained its own six-person sustainability department for just over a year. ""I once learned that you should leave a place in better condition than you found it.

293,2023-04-02,DW News,Middle East: Why are Ramadan TV specials so controversial? – DW – 03/31/2023,"Every year, new TV series are released during the Muslim religious holiday. And every year, some cause controversy, upsetting clerics, governments or activists. Media analysts in the Middle East say they know why. The scandals have become something of a holiday tradition. Every year, during the month-long Muslim month of fasting, Ramadan, there will be at least one major dispute arising out of what is commonly known as the  season of new television shows. In the recent past, new series released during Ramadan have seen ambassadors summoned, clerics lectured and activist groups protesting.This year's Ramadan is no exception.The Tunisian education minister has already called for a Tunisian-made series, Fallujah, to be banned from local screens. It portrays the dark side of local student life, complete with drug deals and students beating a teacher. A legal bid has also been launched to take it off the air.In Iraq, a historical drama series called ""Muawiya"" (Muawiya is the name of the first Islamic caliph), has also been banned. It looks at the first Muslim civil war, an event that led to the rancorous split between Shiite Muslims and Sunni Muslims which still exists today.And another new Iraqi series called ""Al Kasser"" (The Predator) has also been cancelled there because senior members of  said the historic series insulted the tribes of southern Iraq, depicting their leaders as primitive tyrants obsessed with sex and power. The private TV channel that broadcast the show had received threats and, , the country's federal media-monitoring commission explained that it had banned the broadcast in the interests of ""social cohesion.""But this is not surprising. Scandals around the extremely popular Ramadan TV shows have become almost as much of a tradition as the holiday itself.During , observant Muslims fast during the day. After sunset, restaurants open and families come together . As a result, the whole pattern of daily life shifts during Ramadan, people stay up late and one of the most popular evening activities involves  of a new TV series  together after dinner. These series often start at the beginning of the holiday and screen a new episode every night, or every second or third night, before finishing up at the end of the month.""Ramadan is not just a time of fasting and reflection, it's also a time of peak TV viewing and shifting entertainment preferences,"" said Joe Khalil, an associate professor of global media at Northwestern University in Qatar, who has authored a number of studies and books on television made in the Middle East.A survey commissioned by Netflix in 2018 found that, during , television viewership in the region shot up by around 80% and that peak viewing times shifted, moving to between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. Other surveys show that the cost of advertising slots on satellite channels during popular Ramada series will triple.This is why Ramadan TV series offer something for everyone, from spies and pranksters, historic tales of war and adventure, celebrity chefs, game shows, soap operas and comedies.Èxperts in the sector have some theories as to why controversies around these TV series are also predictable.It may partially be due to the fact that Ramadan is a religious holiday, which makes associations with socially controversial subjects, and standard soap opera fare, more sensitive. It may also be that so many more people are paying attention. But mostly, they say, it's the increasingly intense competition.After the proliferation of Arab-owned satellite channels in the early 2000s, the competition to get your show in front of Ramadan viewers has increased substantially, said Ahmad Hayat, an assistant professor of journalism and electronic media at the University of Tennessee in the US, whose past research has focused on Kuwaiti Ramadan series.Hayat describes the last two decades as a ""network proliferation era.""  ""Now, if you look at audience criticism, the comment you most often find is 'this is repetitive' or 'we've seen this before',"" Hayat told DW. ""So if you're not competitive enough, if you don't have the best stories or something that distinguishes you from everything else on these networks, then it's extremely difficult to have your show put in front of these audiences. And you won't survive,"" he concluded.""Controversies around Ramadan TV shows arise for multiple reasons, including the highly competitive industry environment, where rushed decisions can lead to poor content choices,"" Northwestern University's Khalil confirmed. ""Additionally, as cultures and societies evolve, creative choices and people's tastes change, making it challenging to cater to everyone without upsetting or offending some.""This is also true for the subtle — and sometimes, not so subtle — political messaging in the TV shows. Most production houses and satellite channels in the Middle East have some kind of connection to political figures, as well as widely varying levels of . So just as movies made in Hollywood or China often reflect nationalistic politics and patriotically portray certain kinds of foreigners as the most villainous, so too do those made in the Middle East. And they do this while carefully balancing For example, as Kareem Shaheen, the Middle East editor at New Lines magazine, , a new series that looks at the Ottoman empire's colonial legacy is just the latest show to portray the Turkish negatively. In this way, entertainment can have real life diplomatic consequences, he warned. ""The entrenchment of Turkey's image as an abusive colonial overlord is likely to have far reaching repercussions and to complicate the regional realignment that is taking place today,"" Shaheen wrote.With the increased competition, sector observers also suspect that in some cases, part of a marketing campaign might even involve orchestrating a scandal.Because of the attention traditionally given to Ramadan series, production houses have often already done background checks on everyone who's involved, including researching their political views, what they wear to social events and what they've posted on social media. In other words, they already know which actor or director might be controversial and what reactions they may get.""Producers have become adept at dealing with scandal or even orchestrating it,"" Khalil explained. ""The whole idea is to hook the audience in during the first few episodes. If they can do that, the audience will presumably stick with them for the rest of the month.""Thanks to the Internet and social media, ordinary viewers also have more power. If it gains traction, one influencer's complaint about a show can lead to government intervention. This season in Iraq, a senior Iraqi cleric caused local headlines by criticizing the portrayal of an Iraqi woman in a drama series about Arab women living in London. In the show, the Iraqi was depicted as subservient to women from the Gulf states and this was offensive, the Iraqi cleric argued.In 2021, the historical Egyptian drama, ""El Malek"" (The King), was cut short because of audience complaints about the accuracy of the costumes and even the lead actor's beard, which had religious significance. A 2022 Tunisian series called ""Baraa"" (Innocence) came under fire from local women's rights activists for how it depicted polygamy, which is illegal in the country.Khalil says it's hard to quantify all of the Ramadan TV controversies and their impact.""I don't think that you can say there's more or less [controversy],"" he argued. ""But I do think you can say that, if you look at the continuity of controversies, they are changing in various ways — for example, the socio-cultural aspects or the political orientation, or those created for marketing purposes,"" he concluded.To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that ",Culture,science news

297,2023-04-02,DW News,LGBTQ rights in Egypt: Queer community battles crackdown  – DW – 03/30/2023,"Recent reports suggest that LGBTQ people in Egypt are increasingly being targeted digitally. But activists and observers say that the crackdown is, in fact, systemic. Human rights organizations and news agencies have recently reported that members of the  queer community are being increasingly targeted by the police via fake Facebook accounts or fake profiles on dating apps. ""The authorities in Egypt … have integrated technology into their policing of LGBT people,"" said Rasha Younes, senior LGBTQ rights researcher at Human Rights Watch, in a   on the group's website.LGBT, LGBTQ or  is an acronym that stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning, intersex, asexual and more.""While digital platforms have enabled LGBT people to express themselves and amplify their voices, they have also become tools for state-sponsored repression,"" Younes concluded.However, the London-based Egyptian neuroscientist Ahmed El Hady, who is deeply involved with the Egyptian queer community and who describes himself as ""proudly gay"" on Twitter, doesn't confirm any increased digital crackdown. ""Arrests are systemic and happen all the time on a small scale,"" he told DW. This observation was confirmed by Lobna Darwish, a gender rights researcher at the Cairo-based Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR). ""In the past 10 years, people have been systematically arrested through entrapment on gay dating websites,"" she told DW, adding that ""over this period, the numbers have remained more or less the same."" ""In 2022, we provided legal aid and documented 19 cases that involved 43 defendants who were arrested based on their perceived sexual orientation or gender identity by the vice police, a department that is specialized in combatting illegal sex work, and later accused of charges including habitual practice of ,"" Darwish told DW. However, the majority of these people were arrested after having used one of the commonly used dating apps such as Grindr, Tinder or WhosHere. There is no doubt that it has become  for the police to create fake accounts on these apps. ""The police talk to people and flirt with them for days or weeks until they agree to go on a date,"" Darwish explained. ""Ahead of the first meeting, the police person asks them to bring, for example, some condoms,"" she added. People then get arrested during the encounter, and the condoms are used as evidence for sex work. Then, they are mostly accused of habitual debauchery according to law No. 10/1961, which is known as the law combatting prostitution, or anti-prostitution law. Other common accusations are immorality or blasphemy. But even having cash is enough. ""Any cash, not even large amounts, is used against them as evidence of sex work,"" Darwish said. Homosexuality is not officially illegal in Egypt, but  is rife.In 2022, Egypt's Ministry of Education issued a new directive to combat homosexuality and associated ideas in media outlets and started promoting anti-LGBTQ awareness campaigns in schools. And, according to a 2019 survey by the independent Washington-based Pew Research Center, the majority of Egyptians believe that homosexuality should not be accepted by society. While activists haven't observed any recent increase of digital targeting, they do confirm that discriminatory actions against members of the LGBTQ community have multiplied since Egyptian President  came to power in a  in 2013. This followed a short period of relative calm under the Muslim Brotherhood's democratically elected President Mohammed Morsi, who was removed after only a year in office.Ahmed El Hady told DW that the government seemed to want to avoid ""a large crackdown"" and that ""el-Sissi wants to avoid international attention like in the aftermath of the Mashrou' Leila concert in September 2017.""During the concert in Cairo by the enormously popular Lebanese band, which quit last September after ongoing harassment over their songs and discrimination against the queer lead singer Hamed Sinno, some activists waved rainbow flags in support of the queer community in Egypt. Rainbow flags are widely known as a symbol of the LGBTQ community.
However, following the concert, photos and videos of the flag-waving activists went viral on social media. The Egyptian vice police then , who were given jail sentences of varying lengths for public indecency and inciting immorality.One of those detained, the Egyptian lesbian activist , later turned into a tragic symbol.Hegazi was allegedly tortured and sexually molested by other female prisoners on police orders. The 30-year-old committed suicide due to severe depression stirred by trauma some three years after she was granted political asylum in Canada. As a result of the recent warnings, the US-based dating app Grindr has installed a warning in English and Arabic for its users. ""We have been alerted that Egyptian police is [sic] actively making arrests of gay, bi, and trans people on digital platforms. They are using fake accounts and have also taken over accounts from real community members who have already been arrested and had their phones taken. Please take extra caution […],"" the warning reads.
But for the Berlin-based Egyptian activist Nora Noralla, the executive director at Cairo 52, a Cairo-based legal research institute that defends members of the queer community pro bono, this is nothing but show. ""It is neither the first time they have put this up, nor are they the only ones,"" Noralla told DW.She would much prefer that Grindr, as well as other apps, verified users and forbad police forces to set up profiles. ""With such a warning, they merely create the illusion of corporate responsibility,"" she said. Activist Ahmed El Hady also agrees that Grindr could do more to protect its users, ""but at the end of the day, they cannot fight the government actively,"" he told DW.""If Grindr is infiltrated by the state, they might need to cease operating in Egypt,"" El Hady said. He also knows of cases where even having this app installed on a phone was enough to attract an interrogation by police. Both activists highlight that the queer community has established workarounds to increase the safety of its members. However, for those who are new to the community, these workarounds possibly remain out of reach, at least in the beginning. ""When you meet someone new on an app, you usually check their other social media accounts,"" El Hady told DW. Once the identity of the new contact is confirmed in this way, communications are no longer carried out via the app's messaging platforms but ""via encrypted apps like Signal.""First meetings normally only happen after other members of the community have additionally confirmed the person's identity. ""We meet at safe houses of friends or members of the community, and never use the same location twice,"" he said. Nora Noralla, for her part, sees that the ""community is growing despite the arrests.""""Sadly, the environment is not the best, but we are far from crumbling,"" she says.

But it confirms the tools are there to tackle rising temperatures.Rising temperatures, natural disasters and irreversible  are becoming increasingly life-threatening for humans and nature all over the world, top scientists warned in a major new report released Monday by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.Efforts made so far to avoid passing a dangerous global threshold have been ""insufficient to tackle ,"" but multiple options are still available.""Today's IPCC report is a how-to guide to defuse the climate time-bomb,"" said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. ""It is a survival guide for humanity. As it shows, the 1.5-degree limit is achievable. But it will take a quantum leap in climate action."". "","" said the report, compiled by 93 authors.Humanity has drastically altered the planet in just a few centuries, with responsibility for climate change linked to the burning of coal, oil and gas. At no time in the past 2 million years have CO2 concentrations in the Earth's atmosphere been as high as they are today.The Earth has already warmed by at least 1.1 degrees Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit) compared to pre-industrial times in the mid 19th century. In 2015, world leaders agreed after intense negotiations to limit global warming to a common target of 1.5 degrees. So far, no major country is on schedule to meet this goal.Future scenarios clearly show that climate change can only be halted with a radical transformation of the world's energy system. In addition, the report stressed that measures to adapt to the effects of climate change must already be implemented today. This will save lives and money, when compared with the costs of unchecked climate change on the global economy and society.However, the window of opportunity to achieve these goals is closing fast, the scientists said. By 2030,  from burning coal, oil and gas, or face warming of around 3 degrees Celsius.Guterres called on world leaders and fossil fuel companies to ""massively fast-track climate efforts by every country and every sector and on every time frame."" Speaking on Monday, he presented a plan to accelerate net-zero climate deadlines, invest in realistic innovations and deliver climate justice to those experiencing the worst effects of climate change.""The transition must cover the entire economy. Partial pledges won't cut it,"" he said. ""We have never been better equipped to solve the climate challenge."", set up in 1988, is a United Nations body that analyzes the latest climate research. Hundreds of scientists from around the world study the ongoing impacts and future risks posed by the climate crisis, as well as ways to help people mitigate the negative impacts and adapt to a warmer planet.These experts collectively evaluate thousands of scientific studies, as well as government and industry reports, to produce a comprehensive analysis of how climate change is altering the world.Since 2018, the IPCC has published six in-depth special reports. The current one is an overarching summary of the key findings, the first synthesis report to be published in five years. Although the scientific report is independent, representatives from 195 countries vote on the content of the summary and the recommendations to policymakers. ""The summary is also a measure of what countries are already implementing,"" said Annika Schröder, a climate expert at the German development organization Misereor.To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that Schröder told DW that mechanisms for capturing and , for example, have been given too much prominence in climate change mitigation scenarios. Some of the carbon dioxide removal technologies mentioned in the report are not yet ready for the mass market. While it may be true that the average temperature could be partially lowered with such methods, the IPCC pointed out that the damage caused by the melting glaciers, vanishing Arctic ice or rising sea levels cannot be reversed.A recent estimate from the German Environment Agency showed that the damage caused by climate change in Germany alone could amount to as much as €900 billion ($962.5 billion) by 2050. Speeding up the global response to rising temperatures could theoretically save billions.Schröder said investment and research into  must be carried out. But when it comes to climate protection, she said, we should not wait until they are ready. ""And this is the great danger in the IPCC report.""Matthias Garschagen of Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich said the potential for carbon reduction technologies might make it tempting to ease up on drastic emissions cuts. But he advised against that course of action. ""From a risk perspective, it's not tempting. It has serious risks. We should really try to avoid this,"" he said.Nina Seega, research director for sustainable finance at the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership, pointed out that mitigation and adaptation costs have dramatically dropped over the last decade. ""Against the backdrop of a brewing banking crisis, there is an opportunity for all financial actors to work together to better align the financial system to a net zero, nature positive and equitable economy,"" she said.""A rapid and equitable phaseout of all fossil fuels and a shift to renewable energy is essential and also holds great potential for sustainable development around the world,"" added Sven Harmeling, global policy lead with the NGO CARE Climate Justice Center. — it can determine whether entire ecosystems collapse, island states are washed away or coastal regions become uninhabitable.Limiting warming to 1.5 degrees instead of 2 degrees, for example, would avert around 10 centimeters (nearly 4 inches) of global sea level rise by 2100. That half a degree difference would likely mean that  only one summer per century, instead of once per decade. Even at 2 degrees of warming, 99% of  would be lost., which previously occurred just once a decade, have already become 30% more likely. But with another 3 degrees of warming, intense storms are set to occur two or even three times per decade, releasing one-third more water.which used to happen, on average, once every 10 years, could render the  four times per decade. Heat waves, already 2.8 times more likely and 1 degree hotter than in the 19th century, will become 9.4 times more likely and 5 degrees hotter.There are countless ways to produce fewer greenhouse gases, be it through a diet that includes , electrifying transportation, converting the steel industry to , ending fossil fuel subsidies, expanding public transportation or protecting biodiversity and forests. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that To prevent irreversible climate change, ""massive, simultaneous action"" is needed right now, said Tom Mitchell, executive director of the policy and research organization, the International Institute for Environment and Development.

This will require rethinking nuclear and hydropower production. A relatively  helped stave off an energy crisis there this past winter, but the warm weather itself is now threatening the energy system in other ways.""At the moment, we are in a more comfortable position than expected at the beginning of the winter: gas prices came down by over 80% compared to their August highs, and storage levels are more than double the ones in the same period last year,"" Gergely Molnar, Gas Analyst at the International Energy Agency (IEA), told DW.""But caution is needed,"" he added. The European and global gas markets . ""Any exogenous risk can destabilize them. This year, there is not much flexibility left in the system,"" Molnar explained.Gas demand in the European Union fell 13% year-on-year in 2022, the biggest on record. Meanwhile, electricity generated by hydropower, which is made from water flowing into turbines, registered an 18% drop in 2022, according to an IEA analysis. Without this decline, Europe could have saved even more gas, a necessity after major producer Russia cut off flows to the bloc last year. The fall in hydropower production led to an increase in gas consumption, Molnar said . Historically, hydropower is Europe's second-largest renewable electricity source. It provided 17% of the EU's electricity in 2020, according to Eurostat.Currently, the amount of water in the European reservoirs is almost 15% higher than levels registered in 2022, despite the dry winter in France and the , says Molnar.""But water reservoir levels can fluctuate significantly,"" he explained. ""There is a lot of uncertainty around hydropower output.""The International Hydropower Association (IHA) says that significant investments are needed for water facilities to support the energy transition, while acting like climate mitigators and adapters. ""The need for grid-level flexibility is only going to increase with the rise of solar and wind technologies,"" Alex Campbell, IHA's head of research and policy, told DW. New infrastructures can help manage floods and summer droughts, he added. Lower water levels and higher water temperatures over the summer can influence nuclear power production as well, as river water is often used to handle the  heat discharge.""If the temperature of the rivers goes over certain levels, it can impact the nuclear fleet. We saw it last year, but also in the previous years, both in France and Belgium,” said Molnar.Rivers are also central for coal shipping. ""Once the Rhine levels drop, it can cause logistical issues to coal plants, but coal operators usually have stocks, so low water levels do not immediately translate into issues, "" the IEA analyst said.These long-term trends require attention and a profound rethinking of energy systems, says Carlo Buontempo, Director of Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S). January 2023 was the third warmest January on record in Europe, but this itself would not mean that much, Buontempo told DW.""2022 was one of the eight warmest years, "" he said, ""and the other seven all occurred in the last eight years. Winters in Europe are getting warmer, and there are consequences.""Accounting for snow melt requires an element of predictability in the energy field, as it accumulates in winter and is then available in summer. But over the last 30 years, the ice thickness of Europe's glaciers has decreased by 30 meters on average. The amount of snow, which includes snow in glaciers and other mountain sections, is  for water levels going forward.""This year, we are not in a situation dissimilar to last year. With respect to last year, there is an extra challenge: we are coming from a rather dry year, many parts of Europe are still in near-drought conditions,"" said Buontempo.To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that Summer weather, alongside spring precipitation, is another key factor that will . High summer temperatures increase water temperatures and evaporation while also pushing up electricity demand, especially in Northern Europe.""The rising temperatures demand air conditioning in cities and new geographies,"" said Buontempo. ""Peak domestic energy demand in northern Europe occurs in winter, but we are now seeing a second peak in summer.""Unexpected climate events are additional risks for the EU's energy security. Buontempo recalls how Europe experienced a wind drought in 2021. ""We can dig deep into our risks, using the worst-case scenario, and start from there as a reference point,” he said.Risk modeling and reliable data are particularly relevant to be prepared.""We have to leverage the information we have about what could happen this year, one being the snow in the Alps,” the C3S director said.

302,2023-04-02,DW News,Regional World Press Photo 2023 winners  – DW – 03/30/2023,"Aiming to better represent issues affecting different regions of the world, the World Press Photo contest has added six new regional categories. The global winners will be announced on April 20. In a year marked by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, many photos deal with the situation there. This image shows a woman crying over the body of her father, killed while buying bread in Kharkiv.Ukrainian photo journalist Evgeniy Maloletka has been documenting the war in Ukraine since 2014. His ""Battle for Mariupol"" series shows the cruelty of the Russian war of aggression and takes a close look at the fate of those who suffer most.Mariupol on March 9, 2022: Iryna Kalinina is evacuated from the birthing clinic that was shelled. The baby is stillborn, Iryna dies half an hour later. She named her baby Miron (""peace""). Russian media claimed the photo was fake. Not true, says the World Press Photo Foundation director. ""We took a lot of time to check. These are all real photos.""Photojournalist Evgeniy Maloletka shows death and loss alongside spaces of anxiety and hope. Zhanna Goma (right) and her neighbors hunker down in a shelter in Mariupol.In most parts of the world, this image would not seem particular, but Ahmad Halabisaz's photo shows an act of defiance: The young woman is deliberately defying Iran's mandatory headscarf law. It is one of many forms of protest following the killing of Jina Mahsa Amini in September 2022. The jury awarded this image with an honorable mention, recognizing the power of one person's protest.The 24 winning photos show how global crises affect personal destinies. Khalil Ahmad, 15, from Afghanistan points to a scar that is so much more than a physical mark: His parents sold their son's kidney to feed their 10 children. The boy has felt no joy in life ever since. Since the collapse of the economy in Afghanistan, organ trafficking has risen dramatically.Four Asian countries without access to the sea — Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan — fight over water distribution in times of climate crisis. Photographer Anush Babajanyan documents in her work how the fragile balance and equilibrium between the countries is increasingly becoming unbalanced.Alpacas don't do well with rising temperatures. The series by Peruvian photographer Alessandro Cinque pinpoints the effects of climate change on animals and people — the ""alpaqueros"" have to move further up the mountain with their animals or find another way of life — and efforts by scientists to breed alpacas less sensitive to heat.M'hammed Kilito's series ""Before it's gone"" documents life in an oasis in Morocco. The last bit of water threatens to dry up, along with the plants. The locals face poverty, and leave. Due to rising temperatures, fires and water shortages, about two-thirds of the oases in the country have vanished in recent decades.The men in the photo are bringing water to bee colonies because the levels of the Colorado River have dropped so much. Heat and droughts weaken bees that are key to pollinating flowers. Between 2019 and 2020, bee colonies in the US saw a dramatic 43.7% decline.Here's a positive story, says World Press Photo director Joumana El Zein Khoury, referring to the winning photo series depicting Argentina's World Cup title. In addition to historical events, it was important to the jury to cover different topics. Many of the projects honored aim to show solutions and constructive approaches.",Culture,science news
303,2023-04-02,DW News,India braces itself for intense heat waves – DW – 03/24/2023,"Widespread heat waves in India are anticipated after the country recorded its hottest February since 1901. Projections show that a sizable part of South Asia will experience heat stress conditions.India has already been witnessing above-average  this winter season, with its hottest February in well over a century and the India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecasting an ""enhanced probability"" of heat waves between March and May. Summer seems to come earlier every year in , with the average daytime temperature as much as 3.4 degrees Celsius above the norm, while central India recorded its second warmest February with the average maximum temperature more than 2 degrees Celsius higher than normal. ""Above normal maximum temperatures are likely over most parts of northeast India, east and central India and some parts of northwest India from March to May,"" the IMD said in a statement. Experts predict tougher times with an increased  during the upcoming summer season. The main problem is the threat of crop damage. The maximum temperature in some wheat-growing areas such as Rajasthan soared above 39 degrees Celsius (102 degrees Fahrenheit) earlier this month, nearly 7 C (12.6 F) above normal, according to IMD data. Last year, for instance, India recorded its hottest March, which triggered an early onslaught of heat waves, engulfing several states across northern, central and eastern regions for two months.  then reported 280 heat wave days between March 11 and May 18. Experts are highlighting La Nina as a cause for the heat, which refers to the periodic cooling of ocean surface temperatures in the central and east-central equatorial Pacific that affects global weather patterns.  ""The summer of 2023 is a disaster in the making that will feature an unprecedented heat wave due to a weak western disturbance and the prevailing La Nina condition,"" Abinash Mohanty, sector head of climate change and sustainability at IPE-Global, an international development organization, told DW. Mohanty pointed out that climatological and meteorological conditions coupled with unsustainable anthropocentric activities are causing harsher heat waves that will severely affect food chains. Earlier this week, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) launched its synthesis report on the  saying that despite progress in policies and legislation around climate mitigation since the previous such report in 2014, it is ""likely that warming will exceed 1.5 C during the 21st century."" ""This year has already witnessed anomalies in February, and an enhanced probability prediction by IMD suggests that the situation is going to be tougher in the coming months,"" said Mohanty. Akshay Deoras, a meteorologist at the UK's National Centre for Atmospheric Science and the Department of Meteorology, said early heat waves do not necessarily mean more frequent and intense heat waves. ""While the official forecast suggests an enhanced probability of heat waves over central and northwestern parts of India during March to May, some models disagree,"" Deoras told DW. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that ""Given models have a varying prediction skill, we cannot be sure right now about the enhanced probability of heat waves this season. It is important to remember that the frequency, intensity, and duration of potential individual heat waves in a season cannot be predicted,"" added Deoras. Scientists and meteorologists assert that  and rainfall in India will add to the current water stress in the country. More importantly, premature rains could damage winter-sown crops — such as wheat, rapeseed and chickpeas — just before harvesting begins. According to a study by the Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar (IIT), the frequency of severe heat waves in India will increase 30-fold by 2100. Under a business-as-usual scenario, heat wave frequency might increase 75-fold. ""If temperatures continue to rise and monsoon rainfall patterns continue to change, the country could see a GDP loss of 2.8%, depressing the living standards of nearly half its population by 2050,"" according to a World Bank report in 2018. Sounding a dire warning, the report said almost half of South Asia's population, including India, now lives in vulnerable areas and will suffer from declining living standards that could be attributed to falling agricultural yields, lower labor productivity or related health impacts. Based in New Delhi, the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), a public interest research and advocacy non-profit organization, said that localized climate disasters — on 241 of 273 days until October last year — had claimed at least 2,755 lives, while affecting some 1.8 million hectares of crop area, killing more than 69,000 livestock and destroying 416,667 houses. ""Feeding and powering a heat-stressed India calls for impact-based heat-wave early warning, promoting ways and means to restore the fissured landscapes through nature-based solutions. This can make agri-food systems heat stress ready, followed by a fast-tracked renewable energy deployment across the heat-wave hotspots,"" stressed Mohanty from IPE-Global. Heat waves are termed the ""silent disaster"" as heat-related deaths are often undercounted around the world, according to the World Weather Attribution Network. Judging by recent years, it is increasingly clear that India is among the most vulnerable countries when it comes to climate change. Experts argue that the country's early warning system needs to become more robust. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that  ",Nature and Environment,environment news

He said he his government must ""continue working,"" despite the protests.French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday laid out plans to tackle water crisis, briefly escaping  that have roiled the country for weeks.This was Macron's first major policy announcement and public outing after anger over his decision to  saw Macron said he went ahead with the trip becuase the largely urban protests should not derail his efforts to govern more generallly. ""There are protests, but it does not mean everything must stop,"" Macron said. ""We need to continue working."" However, Macron was greeted in the Alpine village of Savines-Le-Lac by groups of protesters with placards like ""Macron resign!"" and ""Take your pension, not ours."" Macron delivered the plan in Savines-Le-Lac in the Hautes Alpes region of southeast France that has suffered acute water shortages. The town is also located on the edge of Serre-Poncon lake, one of Western Europe's largest man-made reservoirs.The water-saving plan includes an array of measures, from fixing leaking pipes to adapting the way farmers and the nuclear power industry use water, and to make water more expensive for people who are using more than they should need on a daily basis. ""In the face of change, there are necessary constraints, we must explain them, share them and make everyone aware of their responsibilites,"" Macron said. Like much of Europe, France suffered a severe drought last summer amid hot and dry weather. It deprived more than 100 municipalities of water to a point they were not able to deliver drinking water to the tap. The water shortages also exacerbated maintenance-related problems with the country's network of nuclear power plants, with some sites having insufficient available water for cooling, all around the height of rising energy prices linked in large part to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that France has since recorded its driest winter in decades as well. Macron had earlier this month promised his government would devise an urgent ""water plan "" in March given the winter drought conditions.""We have decided to launch 1,000 projects in five years to recycle and reuse water,"" he said. ""We want to reuse 300 million cubic meters, or… 3,500 bottles of water per French person per year."" France currently reuses less than 1% of its water.Climate change would deprive France of 30% to 40% of available water by 2050, Macron said. He laid out around 50 measures to save water, including announcing a gradual price increase for use of water for ""comfort"" so citizens use water judiciously.Major sectors, from nuclear energy to industry, would have to adapt and improve water management.  France recorded 32 days without rain this winter —  the longest such winter drought since record-keeping began in 1959. Snow levels in the French Alps, the Pyrenees and other French mountain ranges were also much lower than usual for this time of the year, according to the national weather service.Weather watchers were worried about depleted water supplies since snowmelt is crucial to filling rivers and reservoirs. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that rm/msh (Reuters, AP)",Climate,environment news
308,2023-04-02,DW News,'You have to win every game': Tuchel's task at Bayern Munich – DW – 03/30/2023,"Thomas Tuchel has been tasked with rescuing Bayern Munich's Bundesliga season, starting with the visit of Borussia Dortmund on Saturday. What tactical changes will he make, and how will he get on with the Bayern bosses?""You have to win every game.""That was the response of 's Director of Sport, Hasan Salihamidzic, on 's  talk show on Sunday morning when asked what makes the job of Bayern head coach so difficult.""We have high aims; we want to win trophies,"" he continued. ""That is the job.""And that is now the task awaiting , will take charge of Bayern for the first time on Saturday against, of all teams, .Not only does Tuchel have history with BVB, where positive memories of a 2017 German Cup triumph were tarnished by the fallout from the  that same season, the Black and Yellows also arrive in Munich as league leaders and with their best chance in years of ending Since the Bundesliga resumed following the World Cup mid-season hiatus, Edin Terzic's side are unbeaten and have picked up ten more points than Bayern, transforming a nine-point deficit into a one-point lead.Bayern, on the other hand, got 2023 off to a slow start with three consecutive 1-1 draws against ,  and , before slipping to defeats to  and , the latter proving ultimately Common to all of those slip-ups was Bayern's vulnerability on the counterattack, with Nagelsmann's preference for flooding the final third repeatedly leaving his own team's defensive line high and undermanned.In Bayern's best periods under Nagelsmann, particularly the start of the 2021/22 season and in the weeks before the World Cup this season, a ""3+2"" or ""2+3"" buildup structure with one full-back pushed high up the pitch saw Bayern able to offer enough cover against counterattacks.But a switch to a ""3+1"" buildup structure (three defenders, usually Dayot Upamecano, Matthijs De Ligt and Benjamin Pavard, plus Joshua Kimmich in defensive midfield) saw Bayern exposed by fast counters time and time again (see diagram below).The warning signs were there in Leipzig when Upamecano was forced to bring down Dominik Szoboszlai. He got away with a yellow card, and Bayern got away with a point. In Mönchengladbach a month later, they weren't so fortunate. Upamecano, again caught out and beaten for pace, was sent off for bringing down Alassane Plea, and Bayern went on to lose 3-2.Even with 11 men, the same problem occurred. At home to Frankfurt, it even happened twice in one counterattack, as Daichi Kamada and Kolo Muani passed their way through Upamecano, De Ligt and Kimmich for the equalizer.And finally away at Leverkusen before the international break, comparable situations led to both  penalties, and ultimately to Nagelsmann's dismissal.""We trusted in Julian and his staff until 11pm [last] Sunday,"" said Salihamidzic. ""But when we analyzed the second half of the season so far, we could see that it was no longer a phase. It was clear that it wasn't working and we had to react.""In Tuchel, Bayern have snapped up one of Europe's top coaches who has ""Hardly any other coach is able to restructure a team so quickly,"" commented  magazine this week. ""Personally, tactically and conceptionally.""Based on his work at his previous clubs, he may opt to have Bayern's defense – which is short on pace since the departure of Niklas Süle to BVB – marking zonally rather than man-to-man, while returning to the ""3+2"" buildup style they were dominant in.What he does in attack remains to be seen, having used a number of different two-forward or one-striker systems in the past. In , he will encounter a striker he has already coached twice before, at Mainz and Paris Saint-Germain.Not that sweeping changes are to be expected on Saturday, with a number of key players only returning from international duty in the second half of this week, and little time for full training sessions.""Now is not the time for big changes or different systems. Some little adjustments, perhaps, but less is more,"" said Tuchel at his introductory press conference, saying that his immediate focus was on ""smelling the grass again, establishing trust and building anticipation.""Within the dressing room, it is to Tuchel's advantage that he is fluent in the three dominant languages in the squad: German, French and English. He could already be seen aiming a light-hearted kick at Leroy Sané's backside during his first training session, before holding a lengthy individual chat with the inconsistent German winger.""He's won big trophies and has garnered national and international experience,"" said Salihamidzic of Tuchel. ""We've spoken a few times in the past and chatted about football. He's a good guy.""Tuchel will hope that bodes well for his personal relationship with his bosses. After all, it was the breakdown of such relationships – for various reasons, and not always down to Tuchel – that led to his dismissals from Dortmund, PSG and Chelsea.Now 49, and having traveled to India for a few weeks of downtime after leaving Chelsea, Tuchel begins work in Munich in relaxed mood, confident in his experience and his abilities, and having impressed at his inaugural press conference, where  described him as ""clear in his answers, reflective in his views, totally focused and full of intent.""As Julian Nagelsmann found out though, the only thing that really matters at Bayern Munich is winning: every game and every trophy.

Individual carbon footprints may be dwarfed by global fossil fuel companies, but we can still make a difference.With the UN's top panel of scientists warning that humanity is running out of time to prevent the worst effects of climate change, many of us may now be asking if we can make a difference — and how.On Monday, the , and that the world urgently needed to end its reliance on fossil fuels.Faced with more frequent, intensifying ,  linked to , it's easy to feel powerless. Despite the urgent warnings, there is a belief that polluting fossil fuel companies cannot be stopped, that governments will not regulate them, that emission reduction targets will never be met.But individually — and in the end collectively — there are many things we can do to help limit the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that supercharge global heating.Transport generates  of the world's emissions, with road traffic as the worst offender.One easy way we can cut emissions is to decarbonize our transport by giving up petrol cars for trains, bicycles, e-vehicles, and, whenever possible, walking — the ultimate zero-emission transport.In cities, electrified transport options from e-scooters to e-buses are becoming a low-emission way to get around. A petrol car pumps out  more carbon than an electric scooter — even when factoring in manufacturing and disposal emissions.For the roughly 10% of the world's population that has ever boarded a flight, favoring trains over planes can also have a big impact. A typical rail journey between European cities emits up to  than an equivalent flight.To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that Farming meat and dairy contributes around 15% of global GHG emissions — not to mention biodiversity loss, contamination of soils and pollution.The IPCC has stressed that a shift to ""diets high in plant protein and low in meat and dairy"" had the  to lower greenhouse gases.So becoming vegetarian — or vegan — could be the way to go for those looking to mitigate their climate impact. A  in climate-friendly  has made that choice even easier.But so far, plants only provide 2% of protein — though that's set to rise to 11% by 2035 and could be accelerated if more of us reduce our demand for meat and dairy, according to the . Schoolkids at the  have shown that it's possible to take a collective stand for the climate. Politicians might not be doing enough, but they have been forced to listen as climate concerns drive voters in elections around the world.And sometimes the courts also listen. In April 2021, young people from Fridays for Future  in a German higher court that a lack of climate action threatened their fundamental freedoms and was unconstitutional. As a result, the court forced the government to strengthen emission reduction targets — which  a couple of months later.With climate ranking as the top issue of concern among a rising generation of voters, many are pressuring politicians on climate via protests, social media campaigns or by writing to local representatives.Demanding carbon neutrality by 2030 — the goal of a citizen initiative for a  in Berlin — is a good place to start.Burning fossil fuels for energy is the largest source of global GHG emissions. This makes choosing green electricity from clean, renewable sources such as wind or solar a great way to cut a key source of climate wrecking carbon.  And consumers have already made a difference. By 2019 in the European Union, the use of renewable electricity generation had doubled from 2005,  of all electricity generation. This means that coal, the highest emitting fossil fuel, no longer supplies most of the EU's electricity.Those living in a house or even an apartment block can also try to install clean solar power on the roof, or electric heat pumps — where possible — as a substitute for gas heating.  are even getting together to run their neighborhoods almost exclusively on renewable energy. Something as simple as turning the heating down can save a lot of energy. That's why the German government, faced with an energy crisis due to the nation's reliance on Russian gas,  to 19 degrees Celsius (66 degrees Fahrenheit) this winter in public buildings.Shutting down computers at night and eliminating ""vampire"" power by unplugging idle electronics is another climate change busting action that can be achieved today. Even easier is to simply turn off the lights when leaving the room.Using highly energy-efficient appliances — induction instead of gas stoves, for example — is another step forward. Better still, demand that your government  at monuments and buildings, a policy recently implemented in Berlin.Meanwhile, around one-third of food grown globally is thrown away. This food loss and waste is a massive carbon emitter when the production, transportation and handling of food is calculated — food that ends up in landfills also generates methane, a highly potent GHG over the short term. In the US, annual food loss and waste creates  of carbon dioxide equivalent GHG emissions, and that's excluding landfill emissions. It's equivalent to the annual emissions of 42 coal-fired power plants.So if we can't eat everything in the fridge, at least compost the rest — to fertilize the garden or for biogas.Meanwhile, pressure supermarkets to stop throwing away extra food, instead offering it to food banks or charities. Or ask restaurants to offer ""doggy bags"" for uneaten food — both measures are included in a  recently passed in Spain.    
Trees are vital carbon sinks, yet deforestation continues at alarming rates — logging of the Amazon forest, for example,  in 2021. More than ever, planting trees is one of the best thing we can do as individuals to reduce CO2 in the atmosphere.While cleaning the air, increasing biodiversity and maintaining healthy soils, trees also save energy — especially in cities where more plants on the street keep things cooler and reduce the need for air conditioning. In the winter, trees can shelter homes from the wind, helping to reduce heating costs by up to 25%.",Nature and Environment,environment news
321,2023-04-02,DW News,Japan accused of failing to block Russia's timber exports – DW – 03/31/2023,"Japanese construction firms are using loopholes to keep buying wood from Russia, despite the sanctions triggered by the attack on Ukraine, activists say. London-based environmental group Earthsight has accused  of not acting to halt imports of more than $410 million (€378 million) worth of what they call ""conflict timber"" from Russia .The activists claim that, , Japanese business continue to buy sawn lumber (processed wood) from Russia's Far East.Sam Lawson, Earthsight director and the report's author, said Japanese consumers are unwittingly helping to fund the war in Ukraine.  ""After international timber certification bodies scaled back or ended operations in [Russia] following Putin's aggression, EU officials declared it impossible for overseas buyers to reliably trace Russian wood to the point of harvest,"" he was ""So it is impossible for these Japanese investors and buyers to be sure their purchases are not helping to fund the murder of innocent Ukrainians, in addition to destroying precious forests,"" he added.All forests in Russia are owned by the state, with a significant portion even directly owned by the Russian military.Ukrainian anti-war and environmental activists have described the profits still being made from Russian wood as ""blood money"" and have reiterated demands first made in March 2022 for immediate sanctions on all Russian timber and wood products.The EU and the UK were quick to impose complete bans on imports of Russian timber in the early stages of the invasion, while the US responded by sharply increasing tariffs. In April 2022, Japan banned imports of logs, wood chips and veneer from Russia, although, by that time, the move was purely symbolic. Moscow had already outlawed exports of those same products to Japan on the grounds that it was an ""unfriendly country.""The government of Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida insists that it is following international sanctions on Moscow. But Tokyo has decided not to stop importing oil and natural gas from the Russian Far East. Moreover, neither Moscow nor Tokyo acted to halt the sale of sawn lumber, which accounted for 90% of their wood trade before the war.  One of the largest suppliers of the wood is reportedly the RFP Group, which has long been connected to , the billionaire former owner of . Additionally, a sizeable portion of the company is apparently owned by the Russian government. Abramovich sold the majority of his holdings in the company in January 2022, although Earthsight says it has paperwork that indicates he still retains a 9% stake. In the same month, Japan's Iida Group purchased a majority stake in the RFP Group. The changes took place one month before Russian forces invaded Ukraine.The Iida Group claims to be the largest builder of houses in Japan. In a statement issued to DW, the company made no comment on whether it intends to halt its operations in Russia.""We are looking at the situation from various points of view and are making rapid decisions, so as not to undermine the value of the shares held by our existing shareholders,"" an Iida Group spokesman said. ""To that end, we will try to collect the correct information and analyze it as the business situation in Russia is changing from moment to moment every day.""The Earthsight investigation also identified Itochu Kenzai Corp, a subsidiary of the Itochu conglomerate that focuses on interior fittings, as the biggest importer of RFP's Yezo spruce lumber.  A spokesman for the company denied that it imports any Russian lumber from the RFP Group.However, Russian customs export documents seen by DW would appear to contradict that claim. The export records show that Amurskaya LK, a subsidiary of the RFP Group, provided ""Coniferous timber, rough, unplaned, unshelled, rough dried lumber"" with a value of around $10,300 to Itochu Kenzai Corp as recently as February 17 this year. The paperwork shows that the 22,580 kilograms (nearly 5,000 pounds) shipment arrived at Nagoya port in Aichi Prefecture.  In 2017, Itochu Kenzai was one of several companies identified by a coalition of NGOs complaining about plywood linked to the destruction of rainforests in Malaysian Borneo, as well as human rights abuses linked to the construction of Japan's new national stadium, which formed the focus of the Tokyo Olympic Games in 2020.  Yet another company identified in the Earthsight investigation is TM Baikal, which is based in Irkutsk and 100% owned by Japanese firms.An official of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries in Tokyo told DW that the situation is ""very complicated.""""The government decides the products that are on the list for import bans and it was decided that sawn lumber would not be on the list,"" said the official, who declined to be identified by name. ""This wood is virtually all used by housing companies but we do not know why this policy has been set like this.""The official agreed that the rules might change in the future, although he emphasized that the lumber imports ""are very important to the Japanese construction industry.""",Nature and Environment,environment news

326,2023-04-02,DW News,Germany: Discrimination against Roma and Sinti on the rise – DW – 03/30/2023,"Roma and Sinti continue to be subject to prejudice in various areas of public life in Germany. The Berlin-based Amaro Foro youth organization has documented incidents in the capital.Over the past year, hundreds of thousands of refugees from Ukraine have arrived in Germany and most have received a friendly welcome. Some, however, have had to prove they are ""real"" refugees by showing their IDs in line for food handouts; others have been the target of racist insults. One family was blocked by security forces at the main train station in the capital Berlin, as its members made their way to a COVID test center. The guards tried to impose a blanket ban on them entering the building.""Since the beginning of the Russian war of aggression, we have noticed that Roma who fled Ukraine are not identified as seeking protection, but as illegitimate refugees,"" said Violeta Balog, the head of DOSTA, a documentation center on antiziganism, which is also known as antigypsyism, at Berlin's Amaro Foro, a cross-cultural youth association of Roma and non-Roma. ""War and crises strengthen ,"" she added. Amaro Foro, according to the group's website, means ""our city"" in the Romanes language. DOSTA says that Germany has a particular responsibilty because of Nazi crimes against  in Europe: ""The German extermination campaign also took place on the territory of Ukraine, the 'Holocaust by Bullets,' that is, mass shootings.""DOSTA has been documenting cases of against people who are Sinti and Roma, or perceived to be, in Berlin since 2014.  It recorded 372 incidents in 2021 and 2022, more than ever since it started collecting the data, but thinks that there were probably a great number of unreported cases.On the recommendation of the Independent Commission on Antiziganism set up by the German parliament, last year a nationwide Reporting and Information Center on Antiziganism (MIA) was established.Mehmet Daimagüler, the Germany's first commissioner for combatting discrimination against Roma and Sinti, confirmed that Roma from  had been discriminated against at all stages of their journey from Ukraine to Germany. In one case, German police and rail staff forced more than 30 people to get off a train because their refugee status was doubted.""I find it intolerable that Roma, descendants of people who survived the Holocaust, some of whom were taken to the gas chambers on Reichsbahn trains, are now being discriminated against on Deutsche Bahn trains,"" Daimagüler told DW.Meanwhile, he said, the chairperson of the Deutsche Bahn board and the chairman of the Central Council of German Sinti and Roma had discussed the matter, and Deutsche Bahn had committed itself to educating its employees about anti-Roma and Sinti discrimination.Refugees from Moldova have also faced very negative experiences in Berlin, according to DOSTA. They are often depicted as Roma and ""illegitimate refugees,"" said political scientist Aron Korozs, who added that in Moldova Roma communities hardly had any access to education and health care. He also said that seriously ill people and heavily pregnant women had been deported from Berlin.Incidents reported include the case of a woman who went to the emergency room of a Berlin hospital because she felt poorly as a result of chemotherapy. She reportedly vomited on the premises and was thrown out by security guards who said to her:  ""You only come here to eat and drink anyway.""In another incident, a Romanian woman lifted a watermelon in a supermarket to see if it was ripe. Security personnel chased her away ""because 'gypsies' always steal."" The woman filed a complaint after the racial slur.  and between 250,000 and 500,000 are estimated to have been murdered. In concentration camps, they were often ascribed serial numbers prefaced by a Z for Zigeuner (the German word for ""gypsy""), which were tatooed on their arms. Balog said the term was ""insulting, racist, hurtful.""DOSTA has found that whether they are shopping, working or dealing with neighbors and landlords,  Roma —  and people who are thought to be Roma — experience discrimination in all areas of life.Balog said that it was difficult for people to defend themselves because often their basic needs, including housing and work, were at stake. Many feared the consequences if they stood up against discrimination. Not without reason: One man who turned to Amaro Foro for advice after facing discrimination from his landlord had been given notice, she said.The 2022 Leipzig Authoritarianism Study found that many people in Germany tended to be hostile when asked about Sinti and Roma. Over half of those surveyed had agreed with the statement ""I would have problems with Sinti and Roma hanging out in my area"" in eastern Germany, while over a third had agreed with it in the country's west. There was even more agreement with the statement ""Sinti and Roma are prone to crime.""Antiziganism has led to a rise in crime against Roma and Sinti in Germany. ""In 2022, 145 antiziganist crimes were reported, including 12 violent crimes,"" the German government said in response to a question from the Left party parliamentary group. Daimagüler told DW that this was the highest figure since these crimes began being recorded in 2017 but probably only showed ""a fraction of the reality.""In another case, a Romanian mother who was looking for a kindergarten place for her daughter had been told on the phone that there were vacancies. When she showed up, she and her daughter were sent away and told there were no places. She said that a few days later, an acquaintance of hers ""who is taken for white"" had been granted a spot at the same kindergarten.Balog said that finding a kindergarten place was not the only problem for Roma. She said that many children waited ""forever"" before being admitted to school. She saide that some school administrators rejected Moldovan children across the board because ""they're going to be deported anyway.""She said that even when they did go to school, Roma and Sinti children often faced bullying from classmates and staff. A 2021 RomnoKher study conducted by the nationwide association of Roma and Sinti found that more than six in 10  experienced discrimination at school.Balog said that racist bullying at school could have a strong impact on the education of children and limit their opportunities. She said that educational establishments had to be open to everybody and that all children should be taught together instead of being divided into seperate classes because of language barriers. She said that children should be given more support to learn German if necessary. , she said, adding there was a need for ""independent complaints bodies with powers.""She also criticized the fact that history books often only mentioned the Nazi genocide of the Sinti and Roma in passing. ""German Sinti in particular have been part of this society for more than 600 years,"" she argued, adding that it was unacceptable that ""we still live in times of ignorance.""The Berlin State Anti-Discrimination Act (LADG) entered into force in 2020. DOSTA says that progress has been made, but antiziganist incidents have still occurred, including on the part of federal agencies, such as job centers as well as social welfare offices, to which the LADG does not apply.In 2019, Balog said that DOSTA had learned of a Federal Employment Agency document that suspected Romanian and Bulgarian nationals of ""organized benefit abuse,"" through a leak.She said that the document had since been amended but that in practice benefit payments were often delayed and applicants were frequently asked for ""irrelevant"" information and documents. DOSTA points out that employment rates for people from Romania and Bulgaria hardly differed from those for the German population in 2021, in order to refute accusations of ""poverty immigration."" Another case is that of a social worker telling a colleague not to pay too much attention to a young woman in a shared residence because she had a Roma background, would soon drop out of school and get married, as that was part of the ""culture."" Horrified, the colleague replied that she too was Roma, had studied and did not have children. To which the social worker had replied: ""Oh, you are Roma? You don't look it.""Aron Korozs said that this was a prime example of how antiziganistic images partly shaped the social work sector, in which a homogeneous Roma culture was that did not exist was assumed. He said that social workers should not lump people together but seek individual solutions. Amaro Foro spokeswoman Andrea Wierich told DW she was worried about the way Roma and Sinti were depicted in the media. She said there had been some improvement but antiziganist stereotypes had not disappeared. ""A beggar is immediately labeled as being Roma, a doctor is not,"" she said, adding that images contributed to stigmatization. ""Roma are often not portrayed as individuals, but as a foreign-looking mass, seen from behind, often wearing long colorful skirts, and with dark hair.""She said that she hoped it would eventually become normal to see Roma and Sinti individuals in the media, ""with a Rom presenting the weather in the daily news program, and not only seen as an activist on World Roma Day.""",Politics,politics news
327,2023-04-02,DW News,EU weighs up future of wood,"As Europe races to replace Russian fossil fuels with cleaner power sources, EU lawmakers are weighing up the future of firewood as a renewable energy source. The debate is getting heated.The European Union’s race to rid itself of dependence on  is well underway. The International Energy Agency says widespread bids to beef up energy security , and EU parliamentarians hope to ramp up  to reach 45% of bloc-wide energy consumption by 2030.The word ""renewable"" often conjures up images of wind farms or solar panels — less so scenes of burning trees. But biomass, which includes firewood, plants and other organic materials, makes up 60% of the EU’s renewable energy mix according to the European Commission.As the bloc now reviews its landmark renewable power legislation, a political battle over firewood’s future is playing out in Brussels.  To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that Because new trees can be planted after others have been chopped down,  gets the renewable seal of approval under EU law. That means member countries can subsidize wood burning, as long as certain sustainable sourcing rules are met.  But Martin Pigeon of Brussels-based forest protection campaign group Fern argues the subsidy setup is ""insane"" as it means ""EU citizens are paying energy companies to burn forests in the midst of a climate and biodiversity crisis.""Industry groups refute these claims. Bioenergy Europe is a Brussels-based nonprofit focused on raising “awareness, acceptance and reputation of bioenergy.” The organization represents more than 150 energy companies and 40 associations — and Policy Officer Irene Di Padua told DW in written comments that responsibly sourced biomass “is essential for the EU’s green transition, especially in providing renewable heat.”  “Bioenergy needs to comply with strict sustainability criteria that ensure sourcing and use of biomass for energy does not cause any environmental harm or biodiversity loss,” she said. Martin Pigeon, however, argues that those criteria are “not strict.” The climate impact of wood-burning is contested. The EU officially counts wood and other biomass as carbon neutral, based on the premise that  through burning will be reabsorbed by more trees in the future. But the European Academies Science Advisory Council says scientific study suggests the trend to replace coal with wood pellets as a means of generating electricity actually increases “atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide for substantial periods of time.""  A  says the time it takes for carbon emissions associated with woodburning to be evened out can range from years to decades or even centuries, depending on conditions. To play this audio please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that The European Parliament wants to limit subsidies for burning wood taken directly from forests, and instead restrict state support to secondary wood products like sawdust. Lawmakers also want to phase down the amount of wood that counts toward EU renewable energy targets.  Nils Torvalds, one of the lawmakers working on the legislation, said the proposal is ""the parliament’s way of trying to limit the unsustainable and inefficient use"" of wood. But Eurelectric, an industry group representing national electricity associations and major electricity companies across Europe, told DW that the European Parliament proposals would ""disturb the practicalities of forest management, lead to further supply shortages of sustainable biomass, and thus impair energy security and increase prices.” In a 2022 letter to EU member states, Eurelectric also argued that the suggestion to restrict subsidies could result in some wood excluded from support under proposals, to decompose on forest floors. ""This causes CO2 emissions but yields no energy,"" the group said. EU member states, meanwhile, prefer a looser definition of which type of wood can be subsidized. One diplomat who asked not to be named told DW ""there’s a feeling that with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with the energy crisis, member states do think that bioenergy is an important renewable source of energy. It has an important contribution to the energy system and to reaching the climate goals.""  Negotiations on the details of the legislation continue this month.  The European Commission has also put forward plans to tighten laws on which firewood qualifies for subsidies. A spokesperson told DW that proposals include barring wood sourced from ancient forests, and only greenlighting state support for lumber from ""highly biodiverse forests when there's no interference with nature protection purposes."" Under the plans, all wood-burning power plants will also have to meet certain greenhouse gas saving thresholds.   But the track record on existing rules leaves room for concern. National authorities are supposed to transpose EU standards into domestic legislation, but the European Commission spokesperson told DW that the body launched legal action against all 27 member states in 2021 for failing to complete this process or failing to notify Brussels of completion.  “We are closely monitoring this process and stand ready to take enforcement actions, if needed,” the spokesperson said.

329,2023-04-02,DW News,Is the ocean a viable solution for water scarcity? – DW – 03/22/2023,"Desalination is highly energy intensive and environmentally toxic. But the unconventional freshwater resource is now vital for human survival in dry regions.While around 70% of Earth's surface is covered with water, less than 1% percent is actually drinkable.These  resources are very unevenly distributed.In hot, dry regions with growing populations and increasing living standards, there is not enough water to go around — a situation exacerbated by climate change. As solutions such as  or even iceberg harvesting remain unproven at scale, the desalination of our oceans into drinking water has emerged as the ultimate means to  regions suffering water poverty.The centuries-old concept uses thermal distillation or a reverse osmosis membrane to separate salt from the sea.The technique is now being utilized globally, with well over  currently operating in over 170 countries — the 10 largest in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Israel.Around 47% of the world's desalinated water is produced in the Middle East and North Africa alone, Manzoor Qadir, deputy director of the United Nations University Institute for Water, Environment and Health, told DW.  These arid regions have few other options since, according to Qadir, they generate less than 500 cubic meters of water per capita through rainfall or river runoff — which is half the upper limit of  as defined by the UN. The United States, by contrast, produces  of freshwater per person.  Water poverty is set to worsen as populations increase along with , with Sub-Saharan Africa predicted to become a ""hotspot of water scarcity"" by 2050, Qadir noted.""It is a great option in terms of enhancing water resources,"" he said of desalination, adding that costs have ""decreased tremendously"" — from around $5 ($4.69) per cubic meter (1,000 liters) in the 2000s to 50 cents today.""It's a no brainer,"" said Frithjof C. Kuepper, chair in marine biodiversity at the University of Aberdeen and an expert on the environmental impacts of desalination in Cyprus.  ""For countries like Cyrpus, there's no other option if they want to maintain this living standard.""The hottest and driest nation in the EU, Cyprus relies on desalination for 80% of its drinking water, according to Kuepper. With variable rainfall necessitating water restrictions in the country as far back as the 1990s, Kuepper explains that Cyprus' government first tried to make up the shortfall by shipping in water from Greece.""But it cost about ten times more than desalinating,"" he said, adding that the government started to build desalination plants in the early 2000s to avoid water shortages.But both Kuepper and Qadir concede that before becoming a magic bullet for water scarcity, desalination presents some serious environmental trade-offs in its current guise.To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that Firstly, separating salt from water is highly energy intensive. A on the environmental consequences of removing salt from seawater in Cyprus co-authored by Kuepper showed that the four desalination plants in the country generate around 2% of its total greenhouse gas emissions.The plants also accounted for 5% of the total electricity consumption in Cyprus, representing one of the largest shares by sector of electricity consumption, according to the study.Furthermore, the report notes that desalinated water produced generated around 103 million cubic meters of toxic, high-salinity brine effluent that impacted the Mediterranean  in the region of the discharge pipes.In a co-authored by Manzoor Qadir on the state of desalination and brine production globally, it was shown that increased salinity, combined with climate-driven temperature rise, can cause a decrease in the dissolved oxygen content, resulting in conditions called hypoxia.This hypersaline water can sink to the ocean bed and kill marine microorganisms that are vital to the entire food chain. In addition, chemical compounds such as copper and chloride are also observable in the desalination pre-treatment process and can be toxic to organisms in the receiving water, according to the report.The authors of the Cyprus study conclude that the solution to the relatively high CO2 emissions is to deploy renewables to power desalination plants.A Berlin-based company, Boreal Light, has developed off-grid solar and wind energy desalination plants that ensure greater energy independence and immunity from price fluctuations.   ""We've got the water for free, we've got the electricity from the solar and wind for free, so we can now produce 1,000 liters [of fresh water] for 50 cents,"" Ali Al-Hakim, Boreal Light co-founder and general manager, told DW. The price for one cubic meter is as competitive as directly accessing freshwater from rivers or wells, he added — and is equal to today's cheaper desalination cost as quoted by Manzoor Qadir.Meanwhile, though brine discharge can be better diffused through outfall pipes that are not in the vicinity of vulnerable marine life, Kuepper said a better solution would be to keep the remnant solids on the land.  To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that The 2019 study on the state of desalination showed how sodium, magnesium, calcium, potassium, bromine, boron, strontium, lithium, rubidium and uranium could be harvested from the filtered material and reused in industry and agriculture. Recovery of these resources remains economically uncompetitive, however, Qadir believes.This needs to change as reuse is an important sustainability solution, he added, especially ""in countries producing large volumes of brine with relatively low efficiencies, such as Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait and Qatar.""Scientists at the US research body, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), have suggested ways to repurpose brine by using the salt to produce caustic soda, or sodium hydroxide.When used to pre-treat seawater entering the desalination plant, sodium hydroxide helps prevent the fouling of the reverse osmosis membranes used to filter the ocean water. The researchers note that such fouling is a typical source of breakdowns and adds to the energy inefficiency and overall cost. Although such brine reuse is still in the early developmental stage, Qadir notes that newer, more modern plants in the US that utilize the latest reverse osmosis technology already produce less brine. Around 12% of the world's desalinated water is created in the US but only 3.9% of its brine, Qadir explains. By contrast, the Middle East and North Africa region generates around 47% of desalinated water but 70% of the total global brine output, he says, due partly to the presence of less efficient plants.As the technology continues to improve, climate and environmental impacts will be reduced, says Qadir.Kuepper says desalination is the obvious way to go. ""Our job is to make sure it is sustainable.""

331,2023-04-02,DW News,Right,"In Germany, lay judges hand down verdicts in court alongside professionals. Experts are voicing concern: The influential posts appear to be attractive for people with views hostile to the rule of law.""Rechte Richter"" (""Right-Wing Judges""; no English edition so far) is a book published in 2022 by journalist and trained lawyer Joachim Wagner. Its subtitle asks the question: ""A danger to the rule of law?""Wagner is referring to cases like that of Jens Maier, who was a member of Germany's parliament, the Bundestag, for the  between 2017 and 2021. After his spell in parliament, he wanted to return to his post as a judge in the eastern state of Saxony.This, however, didn't happen, because Saxony's Justice Minister Katja Meier took the matter to court and was successful: Maier, categorized as a right-wing extremist by Germany's domestic intelligence agency, the Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), was sent into early retirement. The verdict is not yet final, however, because the suspended judge can appeal the decision.Nonetheless, the minister is glad about her partial victory in the Jens Maier case.""Enemies of the constitution will not be tolerated in judicial service. All male and female judges and civil servants have to pledge allegiance to the liberal democratic basic order as stipulated by the German Basic Law and have to advocate its observance at all times,"" she said.The expectations of justice professionals also, of course, apply to laypersons and thus to Germany's male and female honorary judges (Ger.: Schöffen). Some 60,000 are required for Germany's approximately 750 criminal courts alone.The application process for the 2023 election of lay judges is currently underway. The participation of lay judges in judicial proceedings is partly intended as a symbolic guarantee that court rulings are handed down ""in the name of the people"" — a phrase spoken before every verdict that is announced. To become a lay judge, a candidate must fulfill only a small number of requirements. He or she must have German citizenship and be between 25 and 69 years of age. The candidate must neither be involved in ongoing criminal proceedings nor have served a prison sentence of more than six months. Legal knowledge is no prerequisite.Low hurdles like these seem to have an enticing effect on those with antidemocratic views. An example: Via social media, the ""Freie Sachsen"" (""Free Saxonians""), a small right-wing extremist party, openly call on their supporters to apply as lay judges ""in order not to leave the judiciary in the hands of left-wing hobby judges.""The Federal Ministry of Justice takes such appeals very seriously. ""Reports on right-wing extremists trying to get access to these posts are very disturbing,"" said Dr. Angelika Schlunck, state secretary to the Federal Ministry of Justice during an event organized by the German Association of Lay Judges (DVS) in Berlin.However, such concerns are nothing new. Already during the last round of applications for lay judges in 2018, the AfD, as well as the right-wing extremist National Democratic Party (NPD) and the , called on their supporters to apply for the influential honorary posts.To prevent infiltration by right-wing extremists, the Federal Ministry of Justice intends to amend Section 44a of the German Judiciary Act (DRiG). Under current legislation, a person must be barred from holding the office of honorary judge if she or he has ""violated the fundamental principles of humanity or of the constitutional state"" or served ""as a full-time or unofficial member of the Ministry of State Security (Stasi — the secret police: Ed.) of the former German Democratic Republic.""Planned legislation by the Justice Ministry specifies that, in addition, people can be removed from the post of honorary judge who ""do not provide guarantees that they will advocate the liberal democratic basic order as stipulated by the German Basic Law at all times.""The Federal Constitutional Court already clarified back in 2008 that the obligation of loyalty to the constitution applies to honorary judges as well . This happened in response to a complaint filed by a lay judge who had been removed from office by the Baden-Württemberg State Labor Court. As a member of right-wing extremist band ""Noie Werte,"" the man had performed in over 200 concerts both in Germany and abroad.Writer Joachim Wagner believes that making generalizations on the basis of isolated cases is wrong: ""I wouldn't go so far as to call this an infiltration."" He does, however, warn strongly against underestimating the danger. ""It is immensely difficult to recognize extremists in advance,"" he says. This is why he advocates preventative measures.According to Wagner, the approach adopted in one of Germany's northern states could be a role model. In Lower Saxony, those who apply for the post of honorary judge have to answer one question: ""Would you have objections to inquiries about your person being made at the Office for the Protection of the Constitution?"" If all other German states followed that example, it would be a step forward, he said at the DVS event.Jörg Müller, BfV head in the eastern state of Brandenburg, has been surprised about the low formal hurdles for approval of honorary judges for a long time. ""I wonder why we're not consulted when it comes to lay judges as we are with the gun control laws."" Since 2020, persons who apply for a gun license have been scrutinized by the BfV with the aim of identifying known extremists early on.",Law and Justice,politics news

334,2023-04-02,DW News,Bundesliga: What now after Bayern hammer Dortmund again?  – DW – 04/01/2023,"Borussia Dortmund shot themselves in the foot in Munich as Bayern stormed back to the top of the Bundesliga in Thomas Tuchel’s first game. But the result poses bigger questions than just what happened in the title race. For 13 minutes in Munich,  were full of the confidence and intent befitting Bundesliga leaders, and roared on by an away support daring to believe that maybe, just maybe … And then Gregor Kobel air-kicked an innocuous long ball from Dayot Upamecano, with predictable consequences: the ball trundled over the line, Dortmund’s confidence and belief evaporated, and Bayern cruised to a 4-2 win to return to the top of the league. ""The result doesn't lie; we deserved to lose,"" said Marco Reus. The Dortmund captain may as well record that message and simply replay it every time he's interviewed after this fixture, which his team has now lost nine times in a row by an aggregate score of 37-8. ""You have crap days, and today was one of them,"" added goalkeeper Kobel, who refused to put his error down to the fact that it was his first start in over a month. His coach, , backed him, correctly highlighting the Swiss stopper's impressive form this season as one of the main reasons that Dortmund arrived in Munich as league-leaders in the first place. ""Tomorrow, we'll look at the table and we'll see that we're only two points behind,"" he insisted, but admitted: ""But today we're disappointed and angry.""Disappointment and anger not only at another listless display in Bavaria but also that his team were unable to take advantage of Bayern Munich’s current identity crisis.  Even as kickoff approached in the Allianz Arena, accusations continued to fly back and forth regarding the club's handling of  and the appointment of  during the international break. ""I found the manner of the change disturbing,"" wrote Bayern club legend Lothar Matthäus in  magazine this week, after Nagelsmann reportedly found out first from the media that he had been sacked and that his employers had already reached an agreement with Tuchel. Some reports even suggest that it was Nagelsmann's management who had to ring Bayern Director of Sport Hasan Salihamidzic, and not the other way around. ""The atmosphere in the club is different, lacking warmth, cordiality and togetherness. And I know that many at the club think that,"" Matthäus continued. Speaking pitch-side before the game, alongside his former teammate Matthäus, now a German television pundit, Bayern chief executive Oliver Kahn took that personally. ""I want to say one thing, since you're always stood here saying the club has no class, no identity. Well, I don't know what you mean. Let me ask you, Lothar, what is this identity? Are there specific ways to behave?""With the Bayern soap opera in full swing behind the scenes in classic 'FC Hollywood' style, Tuchel was left to focus on what he does best: winning football matches. With only one full training session with his new players ahead of his first game in charge, the 49-year-old had already made it clear that ""now is not the time for sweeping changes"" and that ""less is more.""He did attempt to intervene ahead of the opening goal, appearing to motion with his arms to Upamecano to slow down and keep calm in possession. The French centerback didn’t get the message and played a rather aimless ball long, the same one which so bafflingly evaded Kobel and set the tone.  Tuchel barely even celebrated as German football’s so-called '' descended into the usual Bavarian procession. And yet, with every year that goes by, there are more and more reasons to abandon the idea that the brand name which is "" is some sort of clash of equals. Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund may be Germany’s two biggest clubs, but that's misleading: They exist in different financial worlds. It's why this latest episode is less about the Bundesliga title race, which BVB may or may not yet turn around. Less about Dortmund’s apparent collective trauma whenever they go a goal down in Munich. And less about Tuchel and what he did or didn’t have to do on his Bayern debut. It's more about where football in Germany, and indeed further afield, goes now. At least on this issue, if on nothing else, Bayern and Dortmund supporters are singing from the same hymn sheet. In coordinated messages after 30 minutes, the two sets of fans displayed banners criticizing the exemptions to . ""Everyone is equal,"" read the Bayern banner. ""But some are more equal,"" read the Dortmund response, before both sets of fans demanded ""universal implementation of 50+1!"" The problem, of course, is that Bayern do adhere to 50+1. They're probably the best example of it. It's not the  (factory clubs) Wolfsburg or Bayer Leverkusen who have won 10 Bundesliga titles on the bounce. And it’s not Red Bull-backed RB Leipzig, who were soundly beaten 3-0 at home to 100% member-controlled Mainz earlier in the afternoon. ""Fly a load of oligarchs in,"" quipped one reporter in Munich, and it was hard to tell if he was joking or not. Either way, you didn't need Gregor Kobel's disastrous air-kick to show that something isn't working. ",Germany,germany news

The German was widely seen as a lock to be chosen as one of the elites who enter the Hall of Fame, given he's a 14-time All Star selection and the sixth highest-scoring player in league history.Nowitzki's rival power forward Pau Gasol of Spain, twice a champion with Kobe Bryant at the LA Lakers, also made the 2023 cut. And the San Antonio Spurs' French point guard Tony Parker also joined the intake, along with the legendary coach who helped him thrive in Texas, Gregg Popovich. Parker won four NBA titles at the Spurs, all under ""Coach Pop,"" who claimed five himself in more than 25 years in charge. Only five NBA coaches have won five or more titles ever.Nowitzki praised perhaps slightly lesser known Europeans in the NBA who had helped blaze a trail before his generation came into the spotlight. ""I think there were a few guys who blazed the way for us a little bit,"" Nowitzki said. ""And then the next wave came with Pau, Tony and myself. And if we help to make the game truly global and help some kids along the way that's obviously truly humbling for all of us."" The very first European players to be inducted into the Naismith Hall of Fame never made it to the NBA but were honored for their achievements in international or European club basketball. Legendary former Soviet Union guard Sergei Belov was the first international player to be inducted in 1992, having never played in the US. Latvia's Uljana Semjonova from the women's game followed a year later. Kresimir Cosic, a former LA Laker, became the first NBA player from Europe to join in 1996.And behind him, more Europeans like Arvydas Sabonis, Toni Kukoc and Drazen Petrovic — or Africans like Hakeem Olajuwon or  — would go on to qualify.And if top-tier European or international talent was becoming more commonplace by the time Nowitzki, Gasol and Parker were among the international stars of the NBA, it's verging on being the norm now. Greece's Giannis Antetokounmpo and  have won the league's MVP award for best player in all of the last four seasons. And 24-year-old Luka Doncic, who played his rookie year alongside Nowitzki at the Mavs in 2019, seems likely to scale similar heights in time. Three-time NBA champion Dwayne Wade, a local boy born in Chicago, was the leading US men's player in the intake. The explosive guard Wade won the NBA title with the Miami Heat in 2006, 2012, and 2013, and lost to Nowitzki's Mavericks in the 2011 Finals.From the women's WNBA, star player and then trailblazing coach Becky Hammon made the 2023 inductees list. Hammon is a six-time All Star who went on to coach the Las Vegas Aces and lead them to the 2022 championship. She was also Popovich's assistant coach at San Antonio from 2014. And she remains the only woman to take charge of an NBA team during a regular season game when, in 2020, she stepped in as Popovich was ejected from a game against the Lakers. msh/rm (AFP, AP, Reuters)",Sports,science news

337,2023-04-02,LeMonde News,Finnish parliamentary elections: Social democrats counting on Sanna Marin's popularity,"On the international stage, she almost has rock star status – a rather rare occurrence for a Finnish leader. 34-year-old Sanna Marin caused a stir in December 2019, when she became the youngest sitting head of government, leading a coalition of five parties, all led by women, four of whom were under the age of 35. Since then, she has led her country into NATO and become known for her strong positions on Russia.At home too, the leader of the Social Democrats (since August 2020) enjoys exceptional popularity. Everywhere she goes, Sanna Marin attracts crowds. People flock to take selfies with her. Before the parliamentary elections on April 2, her party made her one of its main campaigning points. On their posters, she poses in a salmon-colored top, her hair loose, all smiles, beneath the slogan ""Sinun puolellasi"" (""on your side"").Her re-election, however, is far from guaranteed. Three parties are neck and neck in the polls, each with about 19% of voter intentions. Long in the lead, the conservative National Coalition Party – a historic supporter of NATO membership when the social democrats were holding back – has seen its lead melt away over the past five months. It's now in a dead heat with the nationalist Finns Party and the social democrats.In the consensus-based country that is Finland, coalitions vary depending on the election. In the run-up to April 2, two alternatives ""with distinctively different programs"" have emerged, according to politician Göran Djupsund: ""We could have a government composed of the conservatives and the Finns Party, or the conservatives and the social democrats.""Traditionally, the party that wins the most seats in parliament is tasked with forming the government. In the last parliamentary elections in April 2019, the Social Democrats, led by Antti Rinne, won forty (with 17.7% of the vote), one seat more than the Finns Party (17.5% of the vote). Antti Rinne then became prime minister. But he had to resign in December 2019, threatened with a parliamentary vote of no confidence.The party's number two, Sanna Marin, then Minister of Transport and Communications, succeeded him. A former mayor of Tampere, the country's third largest city, she was still little-known in Finland. Three and a half years later, ""voters across the entire political spectrum have a positive view of her record and that of her government,"" says historian Jenni Karimäki, a specialist in Finnish politics.The scandals that have plagued her term in office do not seem to have dented her reputation or that of her political majority. In September 2022, a survey conducted for the Yle channel revealed that 68% of Finns were satisfied or fairly satisfied by the government's actions – a record, compared to Marin's predecessors. Three weeks earlier, however, Sanna Marin had found herself in turmoil, after the release of a private video, showing her dancing with friends and influencers. She submitted to a drug test to put an end to rumors, which were fueled by the opposition.","Europe,International",environment news
338,2023-04-02,LeMonde News,"Louis Langrée: 'The Opéra-Comique comes from fairground theater, which is its strength'","Appointed general director of the Théâtre National de l'Opéra-Comique in October 2021 by French President Emmanuel Macron, Louis Langrée, 62, launched his first season on Thursday, March 30. The conductor is presenting a program that mixes great works from the repertoire with premieres, emphasizes the confluence of theater and music and shows care for passing things on with the start of a new academy. Le Monde spoke to him about his new role and his ongoing American dream as music director of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra in Ohio, a position he was appointed to in 2013 and continues in 2024.My first mission is to make sure that the word ""opéra-comique,"" which is a false cognate, is well understood. Louis XIV created three theaters: the one with singing, the Opéra de Paris; the one with speaking, the Comédie-Française; and the theater with both, the Opéra-Comique, whose premise is that the literary work and the music are equally important. It is too often believed that the conductor is concerned with what is heard and the director with what is seen. It is exactly the opposite. The director must make the spectator sensitive to the music of the language, while the conductor must make the theatrical power of a work tangible.Yes. Many of them were originally plays. This is the case with Maeterlinck's  (Debussy), Jean Cocteau's  (Poulenc), Apollinaire's  (Poulenc), Franc-Nohain's  (Ravel), Musset's Fantasio (Offenbach). We will also program a contemporary work and a Baroque work because the dimensions of the theater lend themselves to it and give young singers a chance.We must cultivate our identity; it is our language, the treasure we share, the DNA of this opera house. In the history of the Opéra-Comique, there have been 3,000 premieres in 300 years. The pace has obviously slowed down greatly over the centuries, as the repertoire has established itself more and more. But we must continue with the distinctive characteristics that are part of French music. It was an Italian, Lully, who created the ; a German, Glück, who reformed French opera; another German, Meyerbeer, who developed French grand opera, while another German Offenbach lent credibility to operetta. Putting on works in French is not the same as behaving like Eric Zemmour!","French delights,Culture,Performance Art,France",science news
339,2023-04-02,LeMonde News,National Museum of Natural History puts felines in the spotlight,"Do you feel like you know the feline species? Many of us would be tempted to answer this question in the affirmative, as these wild beautiful beasts, both powerful and graceful, mysterious and familiar, captivate our imagination. Given that there are only 38 species in total, far from the 1,200 species of murids (mice, rats, voles), it's not impossible that you may feel like you have an understanding of them.Now try to name them. The lion, the cat, the tiger, of course, three of the 10 favorite animal species of the French. The cheetah, the leopard, the jaguar, the lynx, the puma... That's eight (11, actually, because there are four species of lynx). One more try and perhaps you'll be able to come up with the snow leopard or even the ocelot. And, unless you are a fan or a scholar, that's as far as you'll go. Unless you know the oncilla, or the margay? The fishing cat, the flat-headed cat? The manul, the colocolo opossum?""It's in particular to help people discover this little-known diversity that we have designed this exhibition for the general public,"" said its project manager, Sophie Grisolia. From March 22 to January 7, 2024, the Grande Galerie de l'Evolution of the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle will offer visitors access to the large family of felids. They will have an opportunity to explore the diversity, beyond the three species existing in France (domestic cat, wildcat, lynx), and discover their ancestor – the proailurus (and not the famous ""saber-toothed tiger,"" from which no current feline descends).Above all, visitors will dive into the amazing biology of these fantastic ""hypercarnivore"" predators, kings of stalking, as patient in waiting as they are quick to pounce, even if their success rate in hunting rarely exceeds 20%. They have good hearing, night vision, a delicate touch and a coat of fur that allows them to camouflage. Throughout the exhibition, giant scenes, made thanks to the work of the museum's taxidermy workshop, are placed next to videos and explanatory displays: here retractable claws, raspy tongue – valuable both for scouring the bones and for removing parasites from its own coat – and that mystery that allows cats to fall back on their paws.The cat, as the only feline that has been successfully domesticated, gives a rhythm to the whole exhibition. Certainly, humans have cohabited with lions, making them into demigods and partners in circus acts. Others have tried to hunt with cheetahs as auxiliaries – without doing a convincing job. With the domestic cat, on the other hand, the love story began at least 9,000 years ago, in the Near East – the oldest known tomb shared by a human skeleton and that of a cat is reconstructed here. And Christianity has long mistreated tomcats, especially the black ones. However since the 19 century, the nobility and independence of the animal have conauered the human species. In France, the number of cats even surpassed that of dogs in 2010, reaching 16 million at the last census. As of 2021; there are 600 million cats in the world. Only fledglings and bats complain about it. But whose fault is it, the cat's or the human being's?","Science,Environment,Nature,Zoology,French delights,Exhibitions,Culture,Art",science news

While Mozart's  directed by Claus Guth will arrive crowned with a success that has not waned since it debuted in 2008 in Salzburg, the new production of Wagner's  already appears to be creating the most excitement. The Russian film and theatre director Kirill Serebrennikov directs for his first time in France and he will be joined in the orchestra pit by Gustavo Dudamel, the company's musical director, whose Wagnerian vein was affirmed during the recent revival of, not to mention acclaimed Polish tenor Piotr Beczala.Next up are the tragic heroines. The rarely performed , by Bellini, is Neef's offering to American theatre director Peter Sellars, who has long wanted to direct this opera, which has been notable by its absence from the opera house's repertoire. Singing alongside American tenor Tamara Wilson will be two young up-and-coming Samoan tenors, the brothers Pene and Amitai Pati.Marc-Antoine Charpentier's had not been performed since its premiere in 1693. Conductor William Christie and director David McVicar will accompany its ""resurrection"".  French-Italian mezzo-soprano Lea Desandre will star in the title role of the infanticide mother. There is another resurrected work, one that has not been seen on the bill here for 150 years, Spontini's , in its original French version with the incandescent Elza van den Heever (and the no less volcanic Michael Spyres), under the direction of Lydia Steier. Staging French-language operas is one of the Paris Opera's commitments: Massenet's latest opus, , directed by Damiano Michieletto, will recount the adventurous loves of Ildar Abdrazakov for Marianne Crebassa's beautiful Dulcinea.After the ballet , the British composer Thomas Adès continues his Parisian conquest with the French premiere of his third opera, , inspired by Luis Buñuel's surrealist film of the same name. A nefarious outcrop of rich opera lovers will be dramatically confined by Spanish director Calixto Bieito under the baton of Dudamel. In something very different, it is the nobodies living in a dilapidated building in New York on a hot day that Kurt Weill's depicts, presented by the singers of the Academy at the MC93 in Bobigny in a staging by Ted Huffman under the watchful eye of British musical director Yshani Perinpanayagam. At the Palais Garnier, these same singers will have previously staged  (in double bill of works by French composer Maurice Ravel, coupled with the ballet ) under the direction of Richard Jones and Antony McDonald.","French delights,Culture,Music,Performance Art,France",science news
341,2023-04-02,LeMonde News,"At Musée d'Orsay, Manet and Degas reunite in a friendly and fruitful artistic match","Degas and Manet, it is the marriage of oil and water. Two men who, in principle, were opposed to each other, but who were nevertheless united by mutual respect mingled with a fierce yet fruitful artistic competition. The 20 century saw similar relationships like the friendly rivalry between Matisse and Picasso. In the 19 century, the game was played between Edouard Manet (1832-1883) and Edgar Degas (1834-1917). This is what the Musée d'Orsay is showing with an exhibition produced jointly with the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, where it will go in September, which brings together exceptional loaned artworks.Commissioned by Laurence des Cars before she was appointed director of the Louvre, it was produced by Isolde Pludermacher, general curator of paintings at the Musée d'Orsay, and Stéphane Guégan, scientific advisor. They have brought together 51 paintings by Manet, two pastels, 10 drawings, 16 engravings and a selection of letters. Among this set, 31 of the works belonged to Degas, who avidly collected his colleague's pieces (he had more than 80). ""He essentially lived with Manet from Manet death until his own death,"" said Guégan, meaning for 34 years.There is also a Gauguin, a rather free copy of Manet's  (1863), acquired by Degas in 1895. For his part, he is represented by 40 paintings, seven pastels, 17 drawings, two monotypes (a technique of which he was a pioneer), two sketchbooks – one of which is very surprising – and a few letters. These works, scattered all over the world, many in private collections, made the trip to Paris for the occasion, and we will not see them together again anytime soon.What is the purpose of such a meeting of artistic minds? At first glance, they have nothing in common. ""Admittedly, they are two very different temperaments,"" explained Pludermacher. ""But they have always rubbed shoulders, looked at each other, reacted a lot to each other, dealt with the same subjects, but each time in a very distinct way. What's also interesting about their relationship is that at different times in their lives, they have tried to catch each other's attention without ever succeeding.""It is through testimonies of this friendship, ""enigmatic in many ways,"" emphasized Pludermacher, that the exhibition begins. It was an unbalanced relationship at first: ""In the 1860s,"" she said, ""Manet shone while Degas was still nobody. They met at the Louvre, in front of Velazquez's , which Degas copied by engraving directly on copper foil without going through a prior drawing. Manet was fascinated by this boldness."" Degas, on one hand, seemed at least attracted, if not enchanted, by his elder. He portrayed him on many occasions. Manet, on the other hand, would never depict Degas.","French delights,Culture,Art",science news
342,2023-04-02,LeMonde News,Immigrants in France are becoming more diverse but still face greater economic challenges,"On Thursday, March 30, the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) published a series of demographic studies entitled ""Immigrants and Descendants of Immigrants in France."" It is a societal snapshot of the immigrant population and its descendants, a real-life image of who immigrants are, where they come from, why they migrate, where and how they fit in and what happens to their children later.The publication provides insight into the dynamics at work in a country where the share of immigrants in the population rose from 6.5% to 10.3% between 1968 and 2021. With its immigrant population numbering 7 million, France is in the European average where countries with high immigration rates, such as Luxembourg, Malta and Cyprus, outrank countries like Bulgaria and Romania at the opposite end of the spectrum.Their profile has changed significantly over time. Whereas in France in 1968, 72% of immigrants came from southern Europe and North Africa, they now represent 45% of immigrants (887,000 immigrants from Algeria and 600,000 from Portugal live in France). Since the 2000s, arrivals from Asia and sub-Saharan Africa in particular have been on the rise. Facilitated by free movement, intra-European immigration is also dynamic. In 2021, 48% of the total came from Africa, one-third from Europe and 14% from Asia.Women, who represented 44% of the immigrant population in 1968, are now in the majority (52%). Also, as a whole, immigrants are more highly educated than in the past (43% of those who arrived in 2019 and are 15 years old or older have a higher education degree, compared to 38% in 2006). The reasons for coming to France are also diversifying. Family immigration is declining. (It accounted for only one-third of new residence permits in 2021, compared with half in 2007.) And student immigration – which for the first time was the main reason for entry in 2021 – is rising, as well as professional (13.3% of permits issued in 2021, three times more than in 2007) and political (14.6%) immigration.Once in France, immigrants follow social trajectories that differ from the general population. They are concentrated in large urban areas and border regions. For example, while 10% of the French population in 2020-2021 were immigrants, that proportion reaches 20% in Paris and 32% in Seine Saint Denis [a suburb of the capital], INSEE points out. They also have a clear disadvantage compared to the rest of the population in terms of employment. While in 2021, 7% of people who are neither immigrants nor descendants of immigrants were unemployed, that was true for 13% of immigrants.","France,Immigration",france news

The members of the citizens' convention on assisted dying, who are handing in their final report on Sunday, April 2, were determined to accompany it with a ""manifesto,"" the full text of which  publishes here. It was to be read on Sunday morning in the Palais d'Iena chamber, the seat of the Social, Economic and Environmental Council (CESE) which is organizing the convention.Six members of the convention were designated by their peers to write this text. ""Our role is to be the spokespersons for the collective,"" says Blaise T., one of the authors.

At the end of their discussions, which lasted 27 days, these citizens, who will be received at the Elysée Palace by French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday, delivered two messages that went beyond the subject of assisted dying.First, they called on the government to address ""the health system, [which] is in an alarming situation due to a lack of human and financial resources."" ""We relay the concerns and experiences of health care teams and many of our fellow citizens,"" they wrote.Second, echoing the social protest related to the reform of pensions, they asserted that ""it is time for the citizen's voice to be fully heard and taken into account.""""We are 184 citizens drawn by lottery, rich in a diversity of origins, experiences and opinions.

344,2023-04-02,LeMonde News,Donald Trump's indictment: A new test for an American democracy under strain,"he United States could certainly have done without the new test of the solidity of its institutions that the March 30 announcement of the criminal indictment of Donald Trump represents. The fact that no one is above the law and that justice is done for everyone should be obvious. Trump has only himself to blame. As the first president to be impeached twice by the House of Representatives and the first ex-president to be prosecuted in the history of the country, he brings in his wake an accumulation of cases that show, at the very least, a behavioral problem.The notably sordid case that led to his indictment involved an extramarital affair, hush money and campaign financing, although the world will have to wait until the April 4 hearing to learn exactly what he is accused of. It is almost a peccadillo compared to those charges still pending, linked to his exercise of power: his role in the assault on the Capitol on January 6, 2021, the pressure he put on elected officials in Georgia to distort the results of the presidential election in that state, and the obstinate retention of classified documents after he left the White House.If this case, in which Trump must be presumed innocent like any other person subject to the law, is causing such a stir in the United States, it is because the challenge it represents for American democracy lies at least as much in the former president's inability to respect the basic rules of the rule of law as in his determination to question the mechanisms of the rule of law and to relentlessly attack the justice system as soon as he is called to account.The political benefits of this scorched earth strategy are obvious. By playing again the broken record that invariably presents him as the victim of a ""witch hunt"" and a plot by the ""deep state,"" Trump is forcing his camp to take his side. And he does this at the risk of unleashing the anger of devout supporters who have long been locked into a veritable cult of personality against the recalcitrants.With very few exceptions, since the indictment was announced, Republican officials have been vying with each other in increasingly outraged statements to denounce the instrumentalization of the judiciary for partisan purposes and warning of the divisions they themselves keep stoking. Elected officials in the House of Representatives, where they are in the majority, have already made it known that they want to hear from the New York prosecutor, a Democrat, who is behind the indictment, thus starting a deadly guerrilla war. Two years after the dark episode on Capitol Hill, which it did briefly condemn before absolving its instigator, the Grand Old Party is showing that it still hasn't understood, or learned, anything from Trump.It is true that the particular evil at the heart of all this is an old one. The politicization of the judiciary, fostered by the election of judges and prosecutors, has been dragging the United States down a slippery slope for years. The elimination of qualified majorities in the Senate, once necessary to confirm federal judges such as those on the Supreme Court, removed one of the last safeguards against this danger of polarization. The result is a weakened judiciary and a democracy under increasing strain.","Editorials,United States,Americas,Donald Trump,Opinion,International",science news

It was adopted after a vote at 92 % (162 votes for, out of 176 voters)in the Palais d'Iéna chamber, at the end of their last working session at the headquarters of the Economic, Social and Environmental Council (EESC). The report is intended to present ""a wide spectrum of opinions"" and does not claim to provide a univocal vision. They will present their findings to French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday.Macron wanted this citizens' convention to provide the linchpin for a ""national debate on assisted dying"" that he had launched in September 2022. It was set with the task of answering a question posed by Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne: ""Is the framework of end-of-life accompaniment adapted to the different situations encountered or should possible changes be introduced?""At the end of 27 days of work spread over four months, at the end of some 60 hearings of experts, representatives of religions, philosophers, doctors and caregivers and after a succession of votes, 97% of the citizens drawn at random to be representative of the French population responded that the current ""support framework"" must ""evolve."" Firstly, because of ""the inequality of access to assisted dying support"" in France. Secondly, because of ""the lack of satisfactory responses in the current frameworkfor certain end-of-life situations.""This double observation led them to propose, as a priority, to improve the ""existing framework"" but also to open the door to a change in French legislation. 76 % of the members of the convention were in favor of access to assisted suicide and euthanasia ""under certain conditions and at the end of a marked path.""The first part of the report focuses on defining the conditions for improving support for patients at the end of life within the framework of current legislation, the Claeys-Leonetti law of February 2, 2016. The priority objective in the eyes of the convention participants is the development of access to palliative care, this medicine that treats pain and suffering for incurable patients. They set out 65 proposals. Some of these proposals are included in other official reports on the subject, while others are new: The report calls for the establishment of ""an enforceable right guaranteed everyone"" has access to palliative care.","Health,France",environment news

347,2023-04-02,LeMonde News,Immigration: Let's also talk about the accomplishments of integration,"t has become commonplace in the French political debate to assert that the ""elevator"" of immigrant integration no longer works, or at least not as well as when the newcomers were Polish, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese. This shortcut is questionable because it ""overlooks"" the sum of conflicts, rejections and sometimes tragedies that accompanied the migratory waves of the past. Above all, talk of ""the terrible failure of integration"" does not stand up to scrutiny today, if we refer to the statistics of the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) rather than to the zeitgeist and political strategies.Of course, the social panorama outlined by statisticians in  The figures depict an immigrant population (7 million people, i.e. 10.3% of the population) with multiple handicaps and confined to cities and social housing. The average standard of living of immigrants is 22% lower than that of the rest of the population and their monetary poverty rate is twice as high. They are the most estranged from the labor market, especially when of non-European origin. They are less likely to have a degree, more likely to be unemployed (13% vs. 7%) than average and more likely to live in overcrowded housing. The latest arrivals, Africans, are the least well-off.The picture changes, however, when we look at the descendants of immigrants. While they remain on average more socially disadvantaged than the rest of the population, and while some groups – especially those from North Africa – suffer from higher unemployment, lower wages and discrimination in the labor market, the surprise is that, overall, the level of education of these children of immigrants and their distribution by socio-professional category are very close to the national average. One-third of the daughters and sons of immigrant workers become managers or have a middle-class job. It is the result of a strong rise in the level of education, this clear social ascension is coupled with fairly rapid mixing.More than one in two descendants of immigrants has a non-immigrant parent. The number of mixed unions increases over the generations and, in religious matters, induces a ""secularization dynamic."" While the overwhelming majority of immigrants living in couples have an immigrant as a spouse, two-thirds of their children live with someone without migratory ancestry. And 90% of adult descendants of the third generation are of European descent. Far from the alleged threat of invasion, immigration, in the words of demographer François Héran, ""is not a massive intrusion, but a lasting infusion.""This data contrasted data calls for the revival of a vigorous integration policy – in housing, education and the fight against discrimination – which has been relegated to the back burner of debates on immigration flows, which are also necessary, but do not cover the same issues. The amount of data provided by INSEE – which, it is worth pointing out, was collected without the need for ""ethnic statistics"" – also raises questions about the prevalence of caricatured discourses on integration, which serve to justify xenophobia, and the country's difficulty in valorizing its successes.","Europe,Immigration,Economy,French Economy,Opinion,Editorials,French Politics,France",science news

I observe that ultra-violent groups are diverting non-violent protests from their purpose and contribute to discrediting the cause of environmental activists.I consider that those who legitimize this use discredit the cause to which they are committing themselves. Several branches seem to coexist in this movement against the water reservoirs: On the one hand, those who advocate non-violent action and fall within my mandate and, on the other hand, those who believe that there is state violence that must be met with force. They can also be found in social movements such as the one against the pension reform. Nevertheless, the protests around the reservoirs do fall within the framework of the Aarhus Convention to which my mandate is attached: It concerns both the right to information and the protection of the environment.","Environment,Europe,Climate change,Natural resources,International,France",environment news
349,2023-04-02,LeMonde News,Rallies across France denounce police violence at water reservoir protests,"One of the demonstrators seriously injured in Sainte-Soline, western France, during violent clashes with the police on Saturday, March 25, is still between life and death. On March 30, his mother paid tribute to him in front of the prefecture in Poitiers, where at least 1,300 people gathered to denounce police violence. ""Yes, Serge participated in many anti-capitalist rallies, like millions of young people around the world who think that a proper revolution would not be too much,"" she said, standing on a concrete block, in front of participants who wore blue ribbons on their arms, the color of water, in support of the demonstrators injured on the weekend of March 25.In Toulouse, where Serge is from, his friends also spoke out. At a rally in the southern city that brought together between 400 people according to the police and 1,500 people according to the organizers, they demanded ""justice for [their] indoor football buddy. One of the most respectful and kindest guys we know.""Several dozen rallies organized in front of prefectures and sub-prefectures took place all over France on Thursday evening, ""in support of those injured in Sainte-Soline, the movement against the pension reform and for an end to police violence."" Clashes sometimes broke out in the late evening, notably in Lyon, where a rowdy procession crossed the city center, overturning glass recycling containers and throwing projectiles, before the police used tear gas.In Paris, spontaneous demonstrations also broke out after speeches at the Place de l'Hôtel-de-Ville, in the center of the city. Small groups scattered in the streets burned garbage cans and bicycles and broke some windows of luxury cars. Seven arrests were made in the capital.These gatherings were in response to a call by the three organizations that instigated the Sainte-Soline demonstration: Les Bassines Non Merci, the Confédération Paysanne and the environmentalist group Les Soulèvements de la Terre, which is the subject of a dissolution procedure initiated by Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin, who blamed its activists for the March 25 violence.On that day, when several thousand people gathered to oppose the water reservoir project under construction, 200 people were injured on the side of the demonstrators and 47 on the side of the gendarmes. At the beginning of the week, Darmanin pointed to ""the extreme violence of small groups that have been on the list of intelligence services, sometimes for many years, such as the de facto grouping Soulèvements de la Terre.""","Environment,France,French Justice,Natural resources",environment news
350,2023-04-02,LeMonde News,SNP turmoil in Scotland pushes independence plans further away,"embers of the pro-independence Scottish National Party (SNP) gave Scotland its first Muslim leader, of Pakistani origin, on Monday, March, 27, after electing Humza Yousaf as . The appointment is glaring proof of the openness of the party, which has dominated Scottish politics for 15 years. ""I feel like the luckiest man in the world,"" said the new leader as the results were announced under the watchful gaze of his parents. The next day, Yousaf was named Scotland's first minister by the devolved parliament, which is significantly dominated by the SNP.However, celebrations may be short-lived. The shock resignation announced on February 15 by Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP's figurehead and first minister since 2014, was ""like a pin being pulled from a grenade,"" said Chris Deerin, the influential head of the Reform Scotland think tank, in The SNP, which until the 1990s had been a marginal party, became a machine for winning Scottish regional elections in the 2010s. Until now, it had managed to maintain an astonishing cohesion between its different sensibilities, united under the single banner of independence. But in recent weeks, this great united front has been shattered.The movement's president, Michael Russell,  in early March: the party ""is in a tremendous mess."" During the campaign to succeed Sturgeon, Yousaf, Kate Forbes and Ash Regan (his two leadership rivals) tore into each other in public. Yousaf presented himself as the continuity candidate, progressive on societal matters, and social on the economy. Party members have had a hard time deciding between the candidates: Yousaf, who started out as the favorite, won only 52% of members' votes.The ""Sturgeon system"" also crumbled within a poisonous atmosphere. Stifled by years of stranglehold, sensitive issues suddenly surfaced. Was it right for Sturgeon's husband – Peter Murrell, who has just resigned – to be the SNP's executive director? What happened to the £600,000 (€682,000) that the party set aside for the pro-independence campaign (a police investigation is underway)? Why have a third of the SNP's members vanished in recent months without the leadership saying anything about it?Above all, it is the party's strategy for independence that has come to a dead end. During her eight years as the head of the Scottish government, Sturgeon focused on calling for a second referendum after losing the one held in 2014 (55.3% of voters chose to remain within the United Kingdom), on the basis that Scotland's rejection of Brexit justified another referendum. But this did not pay off. The British government has refused to give it the go-ahead. At the end of 2022, the British Supreme Court confirmed that no valid referendum could be held north of Hadrian's Wall without Westminster's approval.","Europe,French Politics,Analysis,Opinion,International,United Kingdom",science news
351,2023-04-02,LeMonde News,"'The IPCC's consensual policy includes all ""stakeholders,"" including those at the root of the problem'","ow considered at the cutting edge of climate warning, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) initially had the opposite objective when it was created in 1988. It was there to relieve the United Nations (UN) of its climate warning advisory role, taking it on as a body whose appointments and work would be subject to government approval.In previous decades, the UN had indeed taken radical initiatives – the creation of the UN Conference on Trade and Development (1964), in particular – and the influence of poor countries within it was considered too great. The president of the United Nations Environment Program, Egyptian biologist Mostafa Tolba, began to make disturbing statements, calling, for example, for a 60% reduction in CO emissions. For the United States, then the world's largest emitter, it seemed undesirable to let the UN handle an issue that went to the heart of global economic inequality.Since it was difficult to question the work of IPCC Group I on climatological findings, the challenge lay in framing the ""response strategies,"" something which was the responsibility of Group III. This group has a very odd history. In the early 1990s, it was chaired by the American Robert A. Reinstein, whom former president Bush Sr. had appointed as the United States' chief climate negotiator. ,which, to my knowledge, has escaped the attention of historians and sociologists, he ticks just about every box of climate skepticism: correlation is not causation; water vapor is the main greenhouse gas; without CO, ""even vegetarians would have nothing to eat""; scientists are ideologues drawn ""like flies to a lamp"" by this climate business, etc..After heading IPCC Groups III and then II, Mr. Reinstein became a lobbyist for the fossil fuel industries. In 2004, he published  repeating the classic arguments of the merchants of doubt.Group III deals with difficult issues, and its influence on the IPCC has only grown. After the Swedish meteorologist Bert Bolin from 1988 to 1997, two economists have chaired the IPCC. The Indian Rajendra K. Pachauri (2002 to 2015) came from the Tata Energy Research Institute, the strategic foresight center of the famous Indian conglomerate. While chairing the IPCC, he served on the boards of the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation and the National Thermal Power Corporation – an Indian electricity giant and the world's sixth largest emitter. Pressured to resign in 2015 by a harassment scandal, he was replaced by South Korea's Hoesung Lee, who is currently on his way out.","Environment,Climate change,Economy,Opinion,Energy",environment news
352,2023-04-02,LeMonde News,Macron's water plan bets on innovation and restraint,"Available renewable water is dwindling in France, with insufficient rainfall, rivers running low, and declining groundwater levels in most aquifers.The resource has been reduced by 14% over the last two decades, compared to the previous 10 years, and it is expected to decline by a further 30%-40% by 2050. No prospective scientific model ""tells us that the situation will improve,"" President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday, March 30, in the southern French Alps, where he presented a long-awaited ""water plan.""After being pushed back multiple times, this presentation could hardly be postponed again, as the coming summer promises to be even more complicated than the previous one given the worrying state of the vast majority of groundwater.Macron said that 2,000 municipalities had experienced water supply problems last year, of which 340 were supplied by tankers and 200 with bottled water. He called for moderation but did not go into detail about the 53 measures contained in the plan.""Water has once again become a strategic issue for the entire nation,"" he said, voicing a hope that the French will make as much effort to save water resources as they did with energy this winter. Individuals should be helped to equip themselves with rainwater harvesters. And the progressive pricing of water – with the first few cubic meters being the cheapest – currently being tested in several cities, should be generalized.The president wants a ""10% water savings target"" for all sectors by 2030 on the back of an ""unprecedented modernization of [the] national policy."" However, the goals are less ambitious than those set at a large conference on water in 2019, which determined that ""water withdrawals from nature"" should diminish by 10% in 2024 and by 25% by 2034.The Syndicat National de l’Environnement, a union for employees of the environment ministry, and France Nature Environnement (FNE), a national federation of associations for the protection of nature, were quick to point out the plan's weaknesses, although FNE hailed the president's calls for moderation.Macron's first words went to livestock and corn farmers. ""Spring cereal crops dropped by 28.4% in 2022,"" he pointed out. The introduction reflected the overall tone of his speech, which mentioned neither the disruption of the water cycle nor the collapse of aquatic ecosystems. Instead, he focused on technological innovations that could reduce dependence on water resources while allowing all economic activities to continue.","Environment,French Politics,Emmanuel Macron,Natural resources",environment news

On this day in March, men in uniform, leaning against the hood of their service vehicle, were posted in front of one of the entrances to the South River Forest, at the gates of Atlanta, in the southeastern United States. In front of them, the charred carcass of a construction machine was the last symbol of a fight that the city authorities and a heterogeneous coalition of opponents have been waging for nearly two years.At issue is the construction of a huge training center for police officers and firefighters covering 34 hectares of the largest urban forest in the Georgian capital. ""It's a bit of a David vs. Goliath battle,"" said Amy Taylor, wearing red sunglasses on her head and spiked boots on her feet. The 50-something lives just a few blocks away and appeared weary of seeing numerous police officers taking turns near her home every day. ""Sometimes I feel like I'm breaking into my own property,"" she said.These woods, which are full of young and long-neglected trees, are owned by the Atlanta City Council. Amidst the low vegetation stand elms, maples and tulip trees.Where the forest is still accessible, tents have been pitched with canvases stretched between two trunks. From March 4 to 11, opponents of the project called for a week of action to put the spotlight back on their campaign. The event began with the burning of construction machinery and the arrest of 35 people on the outskirts of the forest, where a music festival was taking place. They are accused of having thrown stones, bricks, Molotov cocktails and fireworks. The atmosphere has become even tenser since the death of an activist on January 18.The authorities had decided to drive out the forest's inhabitants. The operation turned into a tragedy. Manuel Teran, a 26-year-old activist known as ""Tortuguita,"" was killed by the police and an officer was wounded in circumstances that remain unclear. Police say the environmentalist fired first, but this is disputed by his comrades, and the officers were not wearing body cameras. According to an independent autopsy, conducted at the request of the family, Teran was shot at least 13 times and had his hands in the air when he died. With little official information available, his relatives have announced their intention to file a lawsuit against the city of Atlanta.Since then, the two narratives have clashed. The state's Republican governor, Brian Kemp, has declared a state of emergency, which allows for the mobilization of a thousand members of the National Guard.

354,2023-04-02,LeMonde News,'We are still a long way from a war economy',"he alarm may not be ringing in the villages of Europe, but in Brussels, officials are talking about the war and its economic consequences. They agree that ammunition and military equipment production should be increased. After 60 years spent building the European Union on the notion that economic prosperity guarantees peace, the conflict in Ukraine is pushing Europeans to revive the military.In June 2022, French President Emmanuel Macron brought back the idea of a war economy. That is the need for a country to mobilize economic resources for the military effort. The consequences are well known to our parents and grandparents: a return to autarky, a collapse of private consumption and state control over monetary and industrial policy.Of course, we are still a long way from that. In a statement on behalf of the French think tank Fondation Jean-Jaurès, economist Renaud Bellais, co-director of the Observatoire de la défense (Defense Monitor), offered some useful data. Currently, France spends 2% of its gross domestic product (GDP) to maintain and equip its armies. This is the spending recommended by NATO and an amount that its partners, such as Germany, are struggling to reach. By way of comparison, when the United States plunged into war in 1942, military spending reached 37% of GDP and 90% of federal government spending. The production of ships, planes and ammunition was gradually multiplied by almost 20.Clearly, we are not there at all. But, as Bellais wrote, the current crisis reminds us that for the past 20 years in Europe, military spending and the size of armies have been halved, while ammunition production has been reduced by 75%. This period, marked by the chiefs of staff's regular complaints, is coming to an end. Not only does the EU want to supply Kyiv, but also to quickly adapt to the new strategic situation. The current level of equipment and manpower of the French army would not allow it to last more than a few weeks in a conflict as intense as the one taking place in Ukraine. As the military says, in the face of rising geopolitical tensions, the French system is too underfunded and poorly structured to be credible.For the French defense industry – the world's third largest exporter after the US and Russia – this new deal holds the promise of a spectacular industrial renewal that will require a lot of investment and human resources. For the rest of the economy, it presages complicated budgetary trade-offs at a time when priorities abound (environment, health, education, etc.).","War in Ukraine,Economy,International",politics news
355,2023-04-02,LeMonde News,War in Ukraine: Duel between two former Olympic fencing champions,"Fencing has made sabreurs Stanislav Pozdniakov and Vadym Gutzeit brothers in arms and close friends, but it is a real war, the one currently taking place in Ukraine, that has separated them, perhaps permanently. After winning the team saber title together at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, after being opponents on the fencing piste, they are now at the head of their respective National Olympic Committees (NOCs): the Russian NOC since 2018 for Pozdniakov, one of the greatest sabreurs of all time, and the Ukrainian NOC since November 2022 for Guttsait, who is also the sports minister.Since the Russian attack on Ukraine, the two men have not been sparing in their choice of words. According to the Russian news agency TASS, in September 2022, during a meeting in Moscow, Pozdniakov declared that ""from the point of view of the Russian Olympic Committee, we, citizens of this country, consider that serving the fatherland is an honorable duty, an honorable duty for all citizens, including members of national teams.""Guttsait's response was delayed, but scathing. ""He is my enemy, he supports the war, he believes it is an honor to participate in the war against Ukrainians, to kill Ukrainians,"" said Guttsait in February in an interview with the Associated Press (AP). ""This person no longer exists for me.""George Pogosov knows both protagonists well. Currently head coach of the fencing teams at Stanford University for the past 20 years, he was also their teammate during their Olympic victory in 1992, won under the short-lived banner of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), created on the ruins of the Soviet Union. Pogosov is Ukrainian and, while he does not hide having ""personal differences"" with Guttsait, he shares hiss view of Pozdniakov.""What he said means that he supports the war against my country. I don't want to hear about him anymore,"" he said. In 1996, at the Atlanta Olympics, Pogosov witnessed the first confrontation between the two men, but it was with sabers in hand. In the quarterfinals of an Olympic tournament that he was about to win, Pozdniakov had won against Guttsait, with the narrowest score that is possible: 15 touches to 14.This did not prevent a strong friendship from developing. There was even a time when the two men were business partners, according to Pogorov. ""With [the Russian foil fencer] Ilgar Mamedov, they were like three brothers, it was the war that separated them,"" said Frenchman Christian Bauer, who was the coach of the Russian national saber teams from 2010 to 2019 and was recruited by Pozdniakov, then president of the Russian Fencing Federation.","Sports,Europe,Russia,War in Ukraine,International",politics news

On Wednesday, March 29 (the deadline for an eviction notice issued by authorities in Kyiv), the Orthodox monks of this church, accused of having links with the Kremlin, ultimately decided not to leave the Ukrainian government-owned Lavra monastery cave complex in Kyiv, and instead to engage in a legal battle. In mid-March, the government agency in charge of managing Ukraine's holiest Orthodox site notified the UOC-MP that it would terminate its lease on the grounds of ""violations [of rules]in the use of state property."" The bishops dispute this claim, calling it a pretext.""The law is on our side. We will stay at the Lavra until the end of the trial. We have a long-term contract that cannot be terminated in time of war,"" said Bishop Pavlo, who is in charge of the monastery. Lawyers for the UOC-MP have filed a lawsuit in a Kyiv court to prevent the eviction. In response, the secretary of the Ukrainian National Security Council, Oleksiy Danilov, said via his press department that ""no one would be dragged out by their feet. There will be no forcible evictions. Everything will be done in accordance with the law.""On a freezing Wednesday morning, hundreds of the faithful and priests attended the religious service given in a church of the immense monastery classified by Unesco as a world heritage site.

When the Russian army withdrew from the city in the Kyiv region, as well as from the rest of the occupied territories in the north of the country, it left behind a traumatized population and a devastated landscape.Photos of the bodies of civilians executed in the streets with their hands tied behind their backs, the discovery of corpses buried in gardens, in mass graves, and testimonies of murders, torture and rapes sparked a wave of indignation around the world. Since then, the Kremlin has continued to deny these war crimes.

It pitted the blonde, wealthy actress Gwyneth Paltrow, 50, against a 76-year-old optician, Terry Sanderson, over a 2016 ski collision in Park City, one of the country's most affluent ski resorts. The incident took place in Utah with its powder snow and 3.4 million inhabitants, 66% of whom are Mormon, who still wonder why the case amused their compatriots so much.The trial, which lasted more than a week in Park City court, ended on Thursday, March 30, with an outright victory for the star. The jury found the retired Sanderson fully responsible for the accident even though it caused him a head injury and four broken ribs. His claim for compensation, amounting to $300,000 (just over €275,000), was rejected. The actress, who is also the CEO of the wellness products company Goop, had filed a counterclaim, for the symbolic amount of $1. When asked on the stand about the injury she suffered, she replied that she had ""lost half a day of skiing.""On February 26, 2016, Paltrow was taking a ski lesson with an instructor (who was paid $4,000 a day, as were her children's two instructors) at Deer Valley Resort, a place where you can drink champagne in yurts at 2,100 meters above sea level but not snowboard. The collision was not on a black run, or even a blue run, but on the near-flat ""Bandana Ski Run"" beginner run.Paltrow claimed that the optician hit her from behind; She immediately thought it was a sexual assault. In contrast, the optician testified that the actress had sent him ""flying"" – which, according to an expert, would have been impossible as she would have had to have been hurling down the slope at 50 km/h. Both protagonists claimed to be downhill from the other, on the slope, and therefore within their rights, under the skier's code of conduct.As no body camera recorded the accident, the jurors were left with the classic ""he said/she said"" dilemma: Who to believe? Faced with the Oscar-winning heroine of the film (1998), it quickly became apparent that the optician with the grey goatee had little chance. Even though the 70-something said that he had lost his zest for life since then – he used to love wine tastings but no longer takes any pleasure in them – his complaints10-centimeter did not earn him any sympathy.Even his lawyer, Kristin Van Orman, did not seem to take her role seriously.

Gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to fall by 0.2% this year before rising again. It is a real  for the Nordic country of 5.5 million citizens that shares 1,340 kilometers of border with Russia, which severed almost all its trade relations with its huge neighbor to the East in just a few months.Kari Liuhto is a specialist on Russia and teaches international business at the University of Turku in southwestern Finland. Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, the economist has changed some of the thematic maps he uses in his lectures: ""I have removed Russia, to show my students that, over the next two decades at least, it can no longer be considered an economic partner, but only a security threat,"" he explained.Most Finnish companies understood this as early as February 24, 2022, when the first Russian missiles rained down on Kyiv. Without waiting for European sanctions, they suspended all of their operations in Russia before announcing, a few weeks later, their definitive withdrawal. Meanwhile, in the Parliament in Helsinki, the MPs were preparing their country's application to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).An example is the cooperative grouping S-ryhmä, which owned 16 supermarkets in St. Petersburg and three hotels, employing 1,000 people. On February 28, all Russian products were withdrawn from its stores in Finland. Less than a week later, on March 4, the management decided to close down all of its operations in Russia. The supermarkets were sold to the X5 Retail Group, while a consortium of entrepreneurs took over the hotels.""We checked that none of the buyers were on the European sanctions list,"" said S-ryhmä CEO Jari Annala. Even though the sale took place under ""less than ideal"" conditions, the group managed to limit its losses. Its operations in Russia accounted for only 1% of its turnover. Why did it react so quickly? ""We are a cooperative, and it was clear that our owners, who are also our customers, wanted to end relations with Russia. But we did not react under pressure because we were of the same opinion,"" Annala said.According to Lenita Toivakka, director of international affairs at the Helsinki Chamber of Commerce, ""at the beginning of the year, 4% of Finnish companies with subsidiaries in Russia were still there, and 13% were waiting for Moscow's green light to withdraw, compared to 25% in May 2022.""

The wind blowing in from the sea almost carried away some blue and white Israeli flags. ""Thank you, Biden!"" shouted one man, who was applauded by passers-by. The day before, the president of the United States embarrassed Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu by reminding him that he was not invited ""in the near future"" to the White House and by expressing, for the first time, the negative opinion he has of the Supreme Court reform promoted by this government.These demonstrators are not giving up, even though Netanyahu bowed to their movement on Monday, March 27, by announcing a one-month ""pause"" in his reform, which aims to free the executive from any independent judicial oversight, and which, since January, has sparked the largest uprising in the country's history. On Saturday, April 1, organizers were planning massive new demonstrations. ""We just completed the first step. It's going to be a marathon,"" warned one of them, Josh Drill, in front of the American embassy.Drill is part of the organizing committee of the so-called ""umbrella"" movement, which is helping to organize logistics in this unprecedented wave of anger that has no clear direction.

If I get arrested tomorrow, nothing changes, the demonstrations have been totally decentralized,"" said the 26-year-old, who once worked for Likud MP Nir Barkat, when he was being encouraged to attempt to dethrone Netanyahu.A political science student, Drill's thesis focuses on the impact of the internet on social movements in Hong Kong, Brazil and in his own country, which has never experienced such a phenomenon. It is secular Israel that is mobilizing against what the protesters call ""a coup d'etat,"" a methodical effort to crush all checks and balances – starting with the Supreme Court – in the name of the extremist agenda of the most right-wing and religious government in history.

They profess their love for the judges, the head of the Central Bank and the economists of the Ministry of Finance, who warn of the consequences of the reform.Drill doesn't think they represent the majority: The country has been tilting further to the right since the 2000s.
